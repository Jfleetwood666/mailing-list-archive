-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
 
    Maybe I'm way behind the curve on this, but...
 
    The traffic analysis that we've seen so far mainly just documents
tcmay's "everybody a remailer" concept.  If you look, you will notice that
these analyses all assume that Alice and Bob are _not_ remailers
themselves, and for a good reason.  If Alice and Bob _are_ remailers,
analysis of the type used here is worthless, especially if Alice and Bob
have a policy of not sending any mail unless they first receive garbage,
and of sending out garbage whenever they get a letter.
 
    HOWEVER, the analysis makes another assumption--that messages are
indistinguishable.  This assumption does not correlate, as I understand it,
with the current remailer net.
 
    There are, as I see it, a couple of modifications that (I think) would
not impose to great a burden on our longsuffering coders, and, as a side
benefit, might allow more flexibility in other matters as well.
 
    Standard packet sizes, as I see it, are not very difficult to
implement, with a couple of assumptions.  (I now assume that all traffic is
intra-remailer-net)
 
    First, the message is signed with the sender's key.  (More on that
later.)
 
    Suppose a signed message to be forwarded is smaller than the standard
packet size.  The sending remailer adds a Cutmarks:  header.  At the end of
the message, the cutmark is added, followed by sufficient garbage to fill
out the standard packet size.  The message is then pgp'ed to the recipent
_with COMPRESS = OFF_.
 
    Upon receipt, the message is decrypted, and its origination can then be
triply verified (at least).  From: line, packet size, and PGP signature.
Since the message claims to be from a packeting remailer, the packet size
should be the standard one.  The recipient now has the message that was
sent to it.  This message is probably itself encrypted, so it can be
handled (almost) as if this message were just received.  This includes
stripping the garbage and (probably) decrypting the message to get the
forwarding information.
 
    Note that this system would allow the extropian remailer to be
compatible with Matt Ghio's alias system.  (Right now, the remailer doesn't
like separate pgp packets, or packets it can't read, or something.) Under
the current system, the precausion is entirely warranted.
 
    To make life even more fun, there is no good reason that non-remailers
cannot be in on the action!  Alice, sending to Bob through Chaum, pretends
to be a remailer.  That is, she prepares her message to Bob, (encrypted),
and adds the Request-Remailing-To:  Bob@nowhere.org, and signs it.  She
then observes that the message is too small, so she adds the Cutmarks:
header, etc.  When Chaum receives the packet, he opens it, removes the
cutmarks, and sees a signature he does not know.  Chaum then sends a
request to pgp-key-server@omniscient.gov for the key, and holds the message
until he gets it.  He then compares the address and name on the key
recieved to the message.  The signature is good, so he is ready to send the
packet to Bob.  But Bob can be in on the game as well, since there is no
reason that he cannot handle the Cutmarks:, the signature, and the nested
encryption.  In fact, Alice could include a copy of Bob's key in the
message for Chaum to use, after a Recipient-Key:  header.  Bob can also
verify that the message was actually routed through Chaum.  If Chaum is
concerned that, at some future time, Eve might supeona his key ring in
order to demonstrate that Alice and Bob are using Chaum, Chaum can
alternately request keys that he does not need from the servers, and delete
(older) keys in the ring.
 
    In other words, if all the remailers can handle nested pgp packets and
cutmarks, we are close to moving all small messages to a standard size.
 
    What if the file is too big?
 
    If the file is too big, break it in pieces.  We need a header,
Multipart Message:  n of m.  Note that since this is assumed to be _inside_
a pgp wrapper, it is secure.  The recipient could hold and merge the files
as needed.  If the message to be forwarded is too big, split and continue.
Since the messages are ascii armored, the split/combine protocal is to
concatenate.  Message parts could be made equal size to minimize the chance
of a message barely bumping over the limit as it moves.  Of course, Alice
could break her message to Bob directly, but we cannot assume that all
would do this for us.
 
    This also means that if Alice sends a message to Bob in the clear
through Chaum, and David, that the message will be encrypted from Chaum to
David.  Thus, if Eve wants to know which message from Chaum to David is the
one from Alice to Bob, (perhaps to know that it is _not_ the message from
Frank she is interested in) she knows only that it was one of the messages
from Chaum to David after Chaum got the message from Alice, and before
David sent it to Bob.  While Chaum and David can both read the message, it
still provides mixing capabilites inside the remailer net itself, and thus,
some protection to Frank.  (Who apparently needs the help.)
 
    A word on remailer keys:  Since pgp uses square-and-multiply for
exponentiation, we see that the amount of work needed to sign a message is
d(m) * (d(e) + o(e)) where d(m) is the digits of the modulous, d(e) digits
of the exponent, and o(e) is the number of ones in e.  (I don't remember
the technical term.) Since the public key is small, each of the parts of
the private key will be large, BUT, there is no reason to assume that we
cannot get lucky, and find an m such that d(e) + o(e) is much smaller than
expected, (d(m) * 3/2, roughly) thus greatly reducing the system demand of
the remailer.  In fact, it might be possible to move to 768-bit keys for
those that have kept their sizes down in the past.  If pgp handles each
prime separately, we look for a double-lucky modulous.  (And a source of
random numbers that does not involve striking keys!)
 
    Cypherpunks come up with really neato ideas for somebody ELSE to
code...  (Sorry guys, but I've not figured out how to get Unix/TCP/etc
working on my Amiga...yet...)
 
 
    By the way, the following key id's are showing on the list, but are not
on the servers:  27D5B76D 231C7021 34ED427F E37385DD.  The first is the
auto-signer at bb.hks.net.  Also, my modem isn't too thrilled with my
connection these days, If the signature fails, look for obvious errors in
the text.  Sorry.
 
 
    "PGP?"                      "ITAR!"                      "Oh, RKBA!"
