&gt; The Assault on Private Encryption
&gt; 
&gt; by Brock N. Meeks
&gt; 
&gt; Washington, DC -- The other shoe has dropped now, several times.
&gt; 
&gt; The political backlash and emotional fallout of the bombing of the
&gt; federal building in Oklahoma City still lingers here. FBI Director
&gt; Louis Freeh is using that event as a lever to wage a kind of private
&gt; war against the use of private encryption schemes.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Administration sources, several different proposals are
&gt; now being discussed on how the government might go about implementing
&gt; a policy of government mandated, government "certified" encryption.
&gt; The most hardline of these proposals would outlaw your ability to
&gt; choose an encryption scheme which the government couldn't break, under
&gt; the authority of a court order.
&gt; 
&gt; Freeh has left no doubts that his next target -- after successfully
&gt; getting Congress to pass the $500 million Digital Telephony Bill,
&gt; which gives law enforcement agencies an "easy access" method of
&gt; eavesdropping on telephone conversations-- his is private encryption.
&gt; 
&gt; During an appropriations hearing in May, Freeh told a congressional
&gt; panel: "[W]e're in favor of strong encryption, robust encryption. The
&gt; country needs it, industry needs it. We just want to make sure we have
&gt; a trap door and key under some judge's authority where we can get
&gt; there if somebody is planning a crime."
&gt; 
&gt; That means an end any non-government approved encryption technology
&gt; that doesn't have some means of providing the Feds with it's treasured
&gt; "back door." Under this scheme, for example, the widely-used Pretty
&gt; Good Privacy (PGP) encryption program would be, essentially, illegal
&gt; to own or at least, illegal for a U.S. citizen to use inside U.S.
&gt; borders.
&gt; 
&gt; Private encryption schemes allow a person to scramble an electronic
&gt; message so that, if intercepted by an unintended party, it is rendered
&gt; unreadable. These scrambling programs are useful to a wide range of
&gt; people and interests, including researchers that want to keep their
&gt; proprietary breakthroughs safe from prying eyes to corporations
&gt; sending trade secrets to a distant office across the Net to ordinary
&gt; folks sending a steamy love letter to a lover.
&gt; 
&gt; But these same encryption programs are being used by "terrorists and
&gt; international drug traffickers," as well, claims FBI Director Freeh,
&gt; and that makes private encryption schemes a threat to national
&gt; security.
&gt; 
&gt; Freeh's crusade against encryption is being backed by been joined the
&gt; Justice Department, with the gleeful back alley goading of the
&gt; nation's top spook group, the National Security Agency.
&gt; 
&gt; To meet the "challenges of terrorism," Freeh said, several things must
&gt; be done, among them, deal with "encryption capabilities available to
&gt; criminals and terrorists" because such technology endangers "the
&gt; future usefulness of court-authorized wiretaps. This problem must be
&gt; resolved."
&gt; 
&gt; While Freeh has used the Oklahoma City bombing as convenient "news
&gt; hook" to again make a pitch to "resolve" the private encryption
&gt; "problem," the Director was basically reading from a dog-eared script.
&gt; Within the last several months he has repeatedly testified publicly
&gt; before Congress about the "evils" of encryption.
&gt; 
&gt; On March 30 the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime he
&gt; said:
&gt; 
&gt; "Even though access is all but assured [by the passage of the Digital
&gt; Wiretap Act] an even more difficult problem with court-authorized
&gt; wiretaps looms. Powerful encryption is becoming commonplace. The drug
&gt; cartels are buying sophisticated communications equipment.... This, as
&gt; much as any issue, jeopardizes the public safety and national security
&gt; of this country. Drug cartels, terrorists, and kidnappers will use
&gt; telephones and other communications media with impunity knowing that
&gt; their conversations are immune from our most valued investigative
&gt; technique."
&gt; 
&gt; Then during a May 3 appearance before the same Committee, Freeh said:
&gt; "Encryption capabilities available to criminals and terrorists, both
&gt; now and in days to come, must be dealt with promptly. We will not have
&gt; an effective counterterrorism strategy if we do not solve the problem
&gt; of encryption."
&gt; 
&gt; But there's nothing to be alarmed at here, according to Freeh. Just
&gt; because he's asking the Congress and the White House to strip you of
&gt; the right to choose how you scramble your messages, using a program
&gt; that the government doesn't hold all the keys too, doesn't mean that
&gt; the Director isn't a sensitive guy or that he has suddenly taken a
&gt; liking to wearing jackboots.
&gt; 
&gt; Freeh steadfastly maintains all these new powers he's asking for are
&gt; simply "tools" and "not new authorities." These new powers are "well
&gt; within the Constitution," Freeh told Congress.
&gt; 
&gt; Freeh hasn't publicly outlined just how he proposes to "resolve" the
&gt; "encryption problem." However, according to an FBI source, several
&gt; plans are in the works. The source refused to detail any specific
&gt; plan, but added: "Let's just say everything is on the table." Does
&gt; that include outlawing private encryption schemes? "I said
&gt; 'everything,'" the source said.
&gt; 
&gt; The encryption debate has been raging for years. Two years ago the
&gt; Clinton Administration unveiled a new policy in which it proposed to
&gt; flood the market with its own home-grown encryption devices -- a
&gt; product of the National Security Agency -- called the "Clipper Chip."
&gt; 
&gt; The Clipper is based on a "key-escrow" system. Two government agencies
&gt; would hold the keys "in escrow", which are unique to each chip, in a
&gt; kind of "data vault." Any time the FBI-- or your local sheriff --
&gt; wanted to tap your phone conversations, they would have to ask a judge
&gt; to give the two government agencies to turn over the keys to you
&gt; Clipper chip. With those keys, the FBI could then unscramble any of
&gt; your conversations at will.
&gt; 
&gt; That policy raised a huge firestorm of controversy and the Clipper
&gt; sunk from sight, down, but not out. The intent of the White House,
&gt; acting as a front man for the NSA and other intelligence agencies
&gt; along with the FBI, was to have Americans adopt Clipper voluntarily
