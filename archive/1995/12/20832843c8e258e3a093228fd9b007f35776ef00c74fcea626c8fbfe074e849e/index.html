What does our man in Intuit have to say about this? 

&gt;  Date: 18 Dec 1995 19:10:07 -0800
&gt;  From: michael@piglet.amscons.com (Michael Bryan)
&gt;  Subject: SSN Shown On Payments by Intuit's Banking Service
&gt;  Organization: none
&gt;  
&gt;  Another user (Robert Mayo) discovered, and I confirmed, that Intuit's
&gt;  online bill payment service sends your payees a printout containing
&gt;  your social security number.
&gt;  
&gt;  This applies to any person who is using Quicken for Windows or
&gt;  Microsoft Money for Windows to send payment requests electronically,
&gt;  using Intuit's service.  It specifically does -not- apply to using
&gt;  Quicken with the Checkfree service, as the Checkfree service does not
&gt;  supply anybody with your SSN.
&gt;  
&gt;  The details:
&gt;  
&gt;  When the Intuit service sends a payment to a merchant, it will do one
&gt;  of three things.  First, it will try to perform an EFT directly from
&gt;  your account into the merchant's.  Most merchant's are still not setup
&gt;  for this, however.  Second, if your payment is the only payment going
&gt;  to a given merchant on a given day, then they will print a check, drawn
&gt;  against your account, and mail it to the merchant.  Both of these
&gt;  methods are ok, and do not result in your merchant receiving your SSN.
&gt;  
&gt;  However, if there are multiple payments going to a single merchant on a
&gt;  given day (i.e., more than one customer has requested a payment to the
&gt;  given merchang), all of these payments are sent in a single envelope,
&gt;  and a summary sheet is enclosed.  This summary sheet will have a field
&gt;  called "Control Number", which consists of your SSN, followed by two
&gt;  other digits.  This summary also lists your checking account number, in
&gt;  addition to your name, account with the merchant, and the amount of
&gt;  your payment.  (In my opinion, only these last three fields are called
&gt;  for.  There is no need for the checking account number to be listed,
&gt;  even though it -is- printed on your check as part of the MICR
&gt;  encoding.)
&gt;  
&gt;  I have contacted Intuit regarding this matter, and they have been
&gt;  decidedly less than helpful.  I know at least three other people who
&gt;  have called them, and we have all been told the same thing:
&gt;  
&gt;  1) "Most of your merchants already have your SSN".  Perhaps this is
&gt;  true for some people, but it is not the case with me.
&gt;  
&gt;  2) "The SSN is encrypted on the printout".  Absolutely not true.  It is
&gt;  printed under the label "Control Number", and has two extra digits
&gt;  appended, but this does not "encrypt" the number.  Anybody who knows
&gt;  what the field contains has instant knowledge of your SSN.
&gt;  
&gt;  Intuit is currently refusing to address this issue.  Furthormore, when
&gt;  I called in, they tried to tell me I was the only person who was
&gt;  complaining.  I immediately gave them the names of three other people
&gt;  who had called in, one of whom I knew had talked to this particular
&gt;  individual.  So that little "divide-and-conquer" trick backfired.
&gt;  
&gt;  Also, when I said that I would be forced to go to the media if they
&gt;  didn't address this issue, I was told that by doing so, I would be
&gt;  responsible for broadcasting this information to those who might then
&gt;  illegally use the information.  I found this two-faced attitude
&gt;  particularly annoying.  On the one hand, they are claiming it's not a
&gt;  problem, yet on the other they tried to keep me from going to the media
&gt;  because it might give criminals information they could then exploit.
&gt;  
&gt;  Anyway, I've done all I can with talking to Intuit, so I am now
&gt;  pursuing other avenues.  My bank (Union Bank) was particularly
&gt;  concerned that the SSN was being printed out and mailed with
&gt;  potentially every payment, and vowed to look into it and work with
&gt;  Intuit on my behalf to get this behaviour stopped.  Also, I and a few
&gt;  others have contacted various media representatives, in an attempt to
&gt;  get them to focus a spotlight on Intuit, and let people know that
&gt;  Intuit is broadcasting their SSN, without their knowledge.  And of
&gt;  course, I'm posting Usenet articles in the privacy newsgroups, as well
&gt;  as the newsgroup where most Quicken discussion occurs,
&gt;  comp.os.ms-windows.apps.financial.
&gt;  
&gt;  If you are using Intuit's Online Bill Payment service, and are
&gt;  concerned about this, please call Intuit and express your displeasure.
&gt;  The number for the Online Bill Payment service is 708-585-8500.  Also,
&gt;  call your bank, and inform them as to what's going on.  Finally, write
&gt;  to your local (or national) newspaper, let them know about this, and
&gt;  ask them to cover this in their paper.
&gt;  
&gt;  It appears that the only way Intuit is going to address this is by
&gt;  getting some negative publicity, since customer complaints don't seem
&gt;  to carry enough weight.  I wish they were more reasonable, but that
&gt;  just doesn't seem to be happening here.  So be it --- they want a
&gt;  fight, they've got one.
