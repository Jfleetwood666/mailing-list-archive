Art says:

&gt;Art Hutchinson and John Kelly of Northeast Consulting Resources, Inc. (NCRI)
&gt;will facilitate an interactive exercise that helps to paint a picture of the
&gt;group's collective thinking about future events and milestones
&gt;in the development of electronic commerce.  Specifically, we will be culling
&gt;through the last year of posts to www-buyinfo, e-payment, and various other
&gt;mailing lists, as well as our own database of 17,000 "events" used in
&gt;previous scenario planning conferences.  From this, we will be create a set
&gt;of about 40 potential future events which - depending upon whether they
&gt;happen or not - will drive the digital commerce arena in varying directions.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Everyone at the lunch will be given an opportunity to 'vote' on and discuss
&gt;with their peers the likelihood (or un-likelihood) of these events happening
&gt;within a particular time frame.  After the 'voting', we will lead a
&gt;discussion of what the results might mean, and how some things that this
&gt;group believes correspond to what other corporate and industry groups have
&gt;said in the recent past in voting on some of the same events.  Suggestions
&gt;for controversial, interesting, watershed events that might happen in the
&gt;digital commerce arena over the next 3-5 years are welcome.  Please e-mail
&gt;them directly to Art Hutchinson at &lt;hutchinson@ncri.com&gt;

This meeting of the Boston Society for Digital Commerce will be held on
Tuesday, January 2, 1995 from 12pm - 2pm at the Downtown Branch of the
Harvard Club of Boston, One Federal Street. The price for lunch is $27.50.
This price includes lunch, room rental, and the speaker's lunch. ;-).  The
Harvard Club *does* have a jacket and tie dress code.

We need to receive a company check, or money order, (or if we *really* know
you, a personal check) payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston", by Saturday,
December 30 (that's two weeks from this Saturday), or you won't be on the list
for lunch. Checks payable to anyone else but The Harvard Club of Boston will
have to be sent back.

Checks should be sent to Robert Hettinga, c/o The Shipwright Development
Corporation, 44 Farquhar Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02131. Again, they
must be made payable to "The Harvard Club of Boston".

If anyone has questions, or has a problem with these arrangements (We've had
to work with a few glacial A/P departments ourselves, for instance), please
let us know via e-mail, and we'll see if we can work something out.

Planned speakers for the following few months are:

 February    Fred Hapgood     Freelance Author
 March       Glenda Barnes    X.9 Electronic Commerce Security Group
 April       Donald Eastlake  CyberCash
 May         Perry Metzger    Security Consultant and Cypherpunk
 June        Dan Shutzer      FSTC

We are actively searching for future speakers.  If you are in Boston on the
first Tuesday of the month, and you would like to make a presentation to the
Society, please send e-mail to the DCSB Program Commmittee, care of Robert
Hettinga, rah@shipwright.com .
