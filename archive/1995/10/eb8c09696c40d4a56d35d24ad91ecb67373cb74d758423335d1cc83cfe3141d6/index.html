ACLU CYBER-LIBERTIES UPDATE
A bi-weekly e-zine on cyber-liberties cases and controversies at the state
and federal level.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*    Universities Censor Student Internet Use

In a knee-jerk reaction to the cyber-porn scare, many universities
around the country have begun to enact policies
to regulate student Internet use.  The ACLU believes that
university censorship of student Internet usage is inconsistent
with the principles of academic freedom.  In addition, state
universities are required as state institutions to uphold the
free speech guarantees of the First Amendment.  The Internet
flourished for years as primarily an academic -- and uncensored --
domain.  Colleges should not now cave in to the Luddites by
enacting restrictive computer usage policies.

Here are a few examples of university computer usage policies
that tread on cyber-liberties:

*  After a year-long battle that made national news, Carnegie
Mellon University is expected this November to approve a policy
to censor certain Usenet newsgroups on Andrew, their flagship
computing system.  Their decision to censor is based on fear that
the university could be held criminally liable under state
obscenity and harmful to minors laws for providing access to
newsgroups that "might be" obscene.  The administration refused
to accept the suggestion of both the CMU Faculty Senate and the
ACLU that the computer network be categorized as a library, which
would entitle the network to an exemption from the Pennsylvania
obscenity statute.

*  The University of Minnesota will not allow students to have
"offensive" content on their web sites, or even to create links
to "offensive" content elsewhere on the Internet.  They have also
adopted the double standard of commercial services like America
Online and Prodigy -- despite U of Minn's explicit content
control, student web pages must include a disclaimer that the
university takes "no responsibility" for anything on the pages.

*  At George Mason University, the "Responsible Use of Computing"
policy begins with the following statement:  "The following rules
are not complete; just because an action is not explicitly
proscribed does not necessarily mean that it is acceptable." 
(One could hardly imagine a better example of ambiguity with the
potential to chill protected speech.)  The policy creates a
Security Review Panel that investigates reports of "offensive"
computer behavior.  As could be predicted, the backlog of cases
before this panel is already quite long.  (The head of the
Security Review Panel is none other than Dr. Peter Denning,
husband of Dr. Dorothy Denning, infamous proponent of the Clipper
Chip.)

On the bright side, students and faculty groups continue to hotly
oppose these policies when they arise, and have been instrumental
in shaping Internet usage policies to be less inhibitive of free
speech and privacy rights.  The following online resources will
be useful to students and faculty faced with a draconian Internet
usage policy:

*  Report on Computers at Harvard, by the Civil Liberties Union
of Harvard: _Very_ comprehensive and useful report on students'
computer usage rights on Harvard's network.  Included are five
general principles for computer use, an application of the
general principles to specific aspects of computer use, and a
discussion of areas where Harvard should take immediate action to
secure students' rights on the network.  Available at
gopher://fas-gopher.harvard.edu:70/00/.studorgs/.cluh/.computer_report

*  Web Site on CMU Censorship Proposal:  Thorough history and
database of documents on Carnegie Mellon University's battle over
online censorship. Also includes information on CMU's Coalition
for Academic Freedom of Expression (CAFE).  See
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/kcf/www/censor/

*  ACLU letter and legal analysis to CMU:  send a message to
infoaclu@aclu.org with "Letter to CMU" in the subject line.

The ACLU will continue to monitor university polices that
restrict online free speech and privacy rights.  The ACLU urges
all students and faculty to actively work for university computer
usage policies that protect their rights.  To inform the ACLU of
a computer usage policy at your school that may violate
cyber-liberties, contact Ann Beeson, ACLU, beeson@aclu.org.

FEDERAL PAGE (Congress/Agency/Court Cases)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
*    Conferees Named for Federal Online Indecency Legislation

Congress recently named the official conferees to the
telecommunications bill.  The Senate version of the telco bill (S
652) contains the Exon Amendment, approved 84-16 by the Senate on
6/14/95.  The House version of the telco bill (HR 1555) contains
the Cox/Wyden Amendment (the Internet Freedom and Family
Empowerment Act), approved 421-4 on 8/4/95.  The House version
also contains Exon-like amendments to the existing federal
obscenity statute, which came out of the House Judiciary
Committee and were adopted as last-minute additions through a
larger Manager's Amendment on 8/4/95.  The conference committee
is in charge of reconciling the differences between the House and
Senate versions of the telco bill, including the obviously
incompatible provisions regarding online content.

While more details are offered in the list below, the following
facts should be highlighted:

_Notable Conferees_
-Senator Exon:  sponsored the Exon Amendment and launched the
cyber-porn scare.
-Senator Gorton: original co-sponsor of the CDA.
-Representative Hyde: sponsored the inclusion of indecency
amendments to the federal obscenity laws in the House telco bill.
-Representatives White, Markey, Goodlatte, Fields, and Barr:  
spoke in favor of Cox/Wyden amendment on the House floor during
the telco debate.

_Some Absent Conferees_
-Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
-Senator Leahy: sponsored the study alternative to the CDA in the
Senate (Senator Leahy is a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee).
-Representatives Cox &amp; Wyden: sponsored the Cox/Wyden "Internet
Freedom and Family Empowerment Act."
-Senators who voted against the CDA.

_Other Notable Facts_
-All the Senate conferees voted for the CDA.
-All the House conferees voted for the Cox/Wyden amendment.
-All the House conferees also voted for the Exon-like indecency
amendments to federal obscenity laws.  However, they may not have
been aware of this vote because it was not a separate vote but
rather a vote to approve the Manager's amendment, which contained
many provisions unrelated to the censorship legislation.
-Given the conferees named, it is highly likely that the House
leadership, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, will play a
substantial role in the conference process.

THE LIST OF CONFEREES:

Conferees from the House were assigned to particular titles of
the telco bill; Senate conferees have jurisdiction over all

-----------------------------------------------------------------
*  Search for Plaintiffs Continues in Suit to Challenge Online
Indecency Legislation
     
As noted above, the online community should continue to urge the
conference committee to remove the censorship provisions from the
telco bill.  At the same time, a coalition has formed to organize
litigation to challenge these provisions if they are signed into
law.  

The first step is the selection of plaintiffs.  We need
plaintiffs who use online networks to discuss or distribute works
or art, literary classics, sex education, gay and lesbian
literature, human rights  reporting, abortion information, rape
counseling, controversial political speech, or any other material
that could be deemed "indecent" and therefore illegal under the
proposed law.

We received a tremendous response to our first call for
plaintiffs, in the last issue of the ACLU Cyber-Liberties Update. 
Thanks to all the organizations who contacted us.  We urge other
groups to join the battle to save free speech in cyberspace.

Please contact Ann Beeson at the ACLU if your organization is
interested in being a plaintiff in this ground-breaking
litigation that will define First Amendment rights in cyberspace.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
*  Effect of Telco Bill on Universal Access

In addition to the online censorship provisions in the telco 
bill, the ACLU is seriously concerned about the effect of 
other provisions in the bill on universal access.

For more information about the effect of the telco bill on 
universal access and other public interest matters, see 
the Ad Hoc Site Against the Telecommunications Bill, 
co-sponsored by Center for Media Education, Computer 
Professionals for Social Responsibility, Consumer 
Federation of America, Electronic Privacy Information 
Center, Media Access Project, People for the American 
Way, and Taxpayer Assets Project, at 
http://www.access.digex.net:80/~cme/bill.html.
