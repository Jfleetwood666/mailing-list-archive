&gt; New, secure version of WebExplorer for OS/2 Warp
&gt; 
&gt; ATLANTA, Sept. 27, 1995--The latest additions to IBM's Internet
&gt; Connection software family will enable companies to encrypt
&gt; Internet transactions and better protect internal networks with
&gt; firewall software as they explore new business opportunities on
&gt; the Information Superhighway.
&gt; 
&gt; Today's announcements include:
&gt; 
&gt;     * A new secure version of the Web Explorer for OS/2 Warp
&gt; 
&gt;     * The IBM Internet Connection Secure Server for OS/2 Warp
&gt; 
&gt;     * The Internet Connection Secure Server for AIX
&gt; 
&gt;     * An enhanced version of the Internet Connection Secured
&gt;       Network Gateway
&gt; 
&gt;     * an enhanced version of the Internet Connection for OS/2
&gt;       Warp
&gt; 
&gt;     * an enhanced version of the Internet Connection for Windows
&gt; 
&gt; "Businesses of all kinds are considering the immense opportunity
&gt; the Internet offers but are reluctant to take the plunge until
&gt; they feel they can do so in a planned, secure manner.  The
&gt; Internet Connection family provides our customers with that
&gt; reassurance, freeing them to explore a whole new world of
&gt; possibilities," said Lois Dimpfel, vice president, Networking
&gt; Software Products, IBM Networking Software Division.
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet is evolving as a means for conducting electronic
&gt; commerce, and the new IBM secure servers and OS/2 Warp client are
&gt; superbly positioned to meet customer security needs.  The IBM
&gt; Internet Connection servers and client support both of the
&gt; emerging security technologies -- Secure Hypertext Transfer
&gt; Protocol (S-HTTP) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) -- to provide
&gt; customers with maximum flexibility.
&gt; 
&gt; New OS/2 Warp client and secure servers
&gt; 
&gt; The new version of the Internet Connection for OS/2 Warp, the
&gt; first Internet client to be included at no charge in an operating
&gt; system, adds security support to an Internet application suite
&gt; that has won generous praise in its first year of availability.
&gt; OS/2 Magazine recently chose the Internet Connection for OS/2
&gt; Warp as a winner in its editors' choice awards.
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet Connection family of client software was also
&gt; enhanced last week.  The Internet Connection for OS/2 Warp,
&gt; provided at no charge as part of the Warp bonus pack, now
&gt; includes table support, streaming graphics, an integrated news
&gt; function and other enhancements through HyperText Markup Language
&gt; (HTML) 3.0 extensions.  These enhancements will also be available
&gt; in the secure version being announced today.
&gt; 
&gt; The InternetConnection for Windows was enhanced with improved
&gt; performance, additional graphic viewers, audio players and other
&gt; features.
&gt; 
&gt; IBM's new web server software provides unmatched scalability for
&gt; customers.  The OS/2 Warp version can run on cost-effective
&gt; desktop systems sold in retail outlets, while the AIX version
&gt; runs on highly-scalable RISC System/6000 platforms.
&gt; 
&gt; Both the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server for OS/2 Warp and
&gt; the Internet Connection Secure Server for AIX were designed to be
&gt; quickly and easily configured using any industry-standard
&gt; browser.  The installation and configuration is menu-based and
&gt; includes online help designed to assist an administrator with
&gt; making the correct choice.
&gt; 
&gt; The new Internet Connection secure servers and clients allow
&gt; businesses and their customers to conduct transactions over the
&gt; 'Net knowing that the data is protected.  For example, an auto
&gt; parts supplier might create a secure web server containing its
&gt; catalog, including high-quality images of the items, on the web
&gt; along with the ability to place an order.  A customer would use
&gt; the Internet Connection secure client -- or an S-HTTP- or
&gt; SSL-compliant client from another vendor -- to browse the
&gt; online catalog, order a part and pay for it with an encrypted
&gt; credit card number.
&gt; 
&gt; Enhanced secured network gateway
&gt; 
&gt; A new version of IBM's Secured Network Gateway, a software
&gt; product generally known as an Internet "firewall," today joins
&gt; the Internet Connection product family.  Formerly part of the
&gt; NetSP product family, the Secured Network Gateway operates on an
&gt; AIX platform to protect a corporation's internal enterprise
&gt; network resources from Internet intruders, while allowing
&gt; legitimate traffic to flow through the firewall.
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet Connection Secured Network Gateway offers a number of
&gt; advanced features, including: proxy server, SOCKS servers, filters and
&gt; domain name service.
&gt; 
&gt; Among several features added to the new version is support for
&gt; AIX version 4.13, in addition to AIX version 3.25.  The new
&gt; operating system support offers customers the option to run the
&gt; Secured Network Gateway on PowerPC hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; Another key feature of the new version is data encryption.  Data
&gt; can safely flow between two firewalls across a public network.
&gt; The firewall encrypts IP data packets, creating a private "IP
&gt; tunnel" from one secure internal network to another.
&gt; 
&gt; The new secure IP tunnels could be used for a company with the
&gt; Secured Network Gateway installed at its various sites to safely
&gt; and confidently transmit sensitive financial data from a branch
&gt; office over the Internet to corporate headquarters.  Customers
&gt; could also use the new feature to securely administer a firewall
&gt; from a remote location.
&gt; 
&gt; Internet Connection directions
&gt; 
&gt; Just as the Internet itself continues to expand phenomenally, the
&gt; Internet Connection family, now consisting of seven generally
&gt; available products, will also grow.  Current product plans call
&gt; for additional web clients on a number of platforms, and web
&gt; server software for OS/400, MVS and selected non-IBM systems.
&gt; 
&gt; "We don't intend to just keep pace with the market; we intend to
&gt; be the pacesetter," said IBM's Dimpfel.  "IBM has worldwide reach
&gt; and strengths like no other company.  The IBM Global Network,
&gt; robust software products, IBM services and gateway software to
&gt; link with existing business systems using DB2 and CICS--all this
&gt; means customers don't have to deal with patching together
&gt; solutions from a collection of vendors."
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet Connection product family is a component of IBM's
&gt; imperative to provide people and organizations with
&gt; network-centric computing, a new model that combines networking
&gt; software, network services and computing devices to facilitate
&gt; computing anywhere, anytime.
&gt; 
&gt; IBM, the world's largest software provider, creates, develops and
&gt; manufactures the industry's most advanced information technologies,
&gt; including networking systems, software, computing systems, storage
&gt; devices and microelectronics.
&gt; 
&gt; Pricing and availability
&gt; 
&gt; The secure server software for OS/2 Warp is $2,999 for the first
&gt; license with additional licenses available for $2,699 each.  The
&gt; AIX secure server software is $4,999 for the first license and
&gt; $4,499 for an additional license.  The Internet Connection Secured
&gt; Network Gateway is priced at $9,999 for the first license, with
&gt; additional licenses available for $8,999.
&gt; 
&gt; The new secure WebExplorer for OS/2 Warp is $35 per copy and
&gt; pricing on the enhanced IBM Internet Connection for Windows has
&gt; been reduced to $59.
&gt; 
&gt; Both secure servers and the secure Web Explorer for OS/2 Warp
&gt; will be generally available in December of this year.  The new
&gt; version of the Secured Network Gateway will be available in
&gt; October.
