 ON MONEY

&gt; -------
&gt;
&gt; While Europe strains to give birth to a new currency, Boris Yeltsin
&gt; toils to resurrect a dead one. With private markets triumphant
&gt; everywhere else, however, the mystery is why governments still have
&gt; to manufacture money at all.
&gt;
&gt; It is still often taken for granted that the one thing private
&gt; markets cannot make is money itself: Only government can do that.
&gt; But new governments of young nations, especially nations with
&gt; turbulent histories, can't make money, either. Nobody quite trusts
&gt; them, and without trust the paper lovingly engraved at the
&gt; government mint is valueless.
&gt;
&gt; Until recently, people put up with a lot of government paper because
&gt; even bad paper was more convenient than the alternative, which was
&gt; barter. Every self-respecting capitalist knew that government paper
&gt; was a perishable good, that it always decayed, slowly in
&gt; Switzerland, fast in Brazil, and most just put up with it. But if
&gt; capitalists can produce candies that melt in your mouth, not in your
&gt; hand, why not currencies, too?
&gt;
&gt; Money, as I wrote here two years ago (FORBES, May 14, 1990), is just
&gt; another network, our oldest medium of systematic communication. And
&gt; new communications technologies are fast surpassing the old. The
&gt; paperless bank, unlike the paperless office, is at hand.
&gt;
&gt; When it works, the old-fashioned paper we call money reliably
&gt; records past effort and promises future return. It's all a matter of
&gt; communication among stable communities of productive people. This is
&gt; why individuals can issue currencies, too -- personal checks, IOUs,
&gt; that sort of thing. Once it's established of an individual that her
&gt; word is her bond, she can in fact issue private currency at will, at
&gt; least among people who know her.
&gt;
&gt; But the trouble with private currencies has always been their
&gt; informational overhead. Personal checks bounce, the "I" behind the
&gt; IOU absconds to Monaco, Macy's defaults on its bonds. Private paper
&gt; is also volatile; pegging current value requires specialized
&gt; information from Wall Street, or a bank in Oshkosh, or a trading pit
&gt; in Chicago. In the past, it's often been cheaper to put up with the
&gt; steady but modest thievery of a central bank, which peels off 3%
&gt; (will it soon be 6%?) of your dollar every year through inflation,
&gt; than to sort out whose private paper is worth what at any given
&gt; moment.
&gt;
&gt; Computers and fiber-optic communications are changing all that. Our
&gt; new central bankers can be concerns like TRW and Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
&gt; which track who's solvent and who's a deadbeat and convey the
&gt; information instantly, at the touch of a button, wherever it's
&gt; needed. Our new mints and engravers can be companies like Visa and
&gt; AT&amp;T, which clear millions of transactions daily, both here and
&gt; abroad.
&gt;
&gt; What enterprises like these supply are the informational ingredients
&gt; of money. They already are far better than Alan Greenspan at
&gt; stabilizing value by assembling baskets of private paper as varied
&gt; and diversified as the global economy. Information about who earned
&gt; a credit yesterday or who can be trusted to pay back a debt tomorrow
&gt; can be passed around as easily as a dollar bill. More easily, in
&gt; fact.
&gt;
&gt; Like religious liturgies conducted in some otherwise dead language,
&gt; transactions may still be denoted in dollars or yen, but these
&gt; vestiges of an earlier age will ultimately give way to a new
&gt; financial vernacular. If everybody paid for everything (wages
&gt; included) by credit card, for example, the accounts could just as
&gt; well be denoted in pork bellies, IBM stock, quarterpounders with
&gt; cheese, or (more likely) some very large basket of hundreds of
&gt; different private goods and services, tangible and intangible.
&gt;
&gt; The Lynch, for example, might be a share in a standard pool of
&gt; commodity receipts maintained by Merril Lynch. Nobody would fully
&gt; trust the Lynch, of course, even if backed by 100% reserves, but
&gt; nobody would have to. Nobody trusts his food supply to any one
&gt; farmer, either. You diversify, you assemble baskets of baskets, and
&gt; you constantly search for quality goods and reliable supply. Same
&gt; with money. When the network and the computers behind it are
&gt; powerful enough, no central authority can or should supply the
&gt; currency, and no one will pay annual tribute by way of inflation to
&gt; the government mint. And with private money, private fortunes will
&gt; no longer be held hostage to public ineptitude in the Kremlin or on
&gt; Capitol Hill.
&gt;
&gt; So back to Yeltsin and how we can help him. Despite the corrupting
&gt; influences of the regulatory collectivist on our own shore,
&gt; America's phone companies and banks are still the best in the world.
&gt; Yeltsin needs them, far more than he needs the International
&gt; Monetary Fund, Pizza Hut or Western investment in Russia's oil
&gt; industry. Modern telefinancial enterprises can deliver the real oil
&gt; of the economy: truly stable media of exchange.
&gt;
&gt; The biggest contribution Yeltsin can make to Russia's fiscal policy
&gt; is to make way for currency capitalists. No exchange controls, no
&gt; bank insurance, no loan guarantees, no criminal prosecution for
&gt; ordinary bankruptcy, nothing but basic, narrowly interpreted laws
&gt; against outright fraud.
&gt;
&gt; Will the new private banks sometimes fail? Of course they will. Will
&gt; widows then be ruined? Certainly. So what else is new? In Russia
&gt; today the only bank in town has failed miserably, and the one cold
&gt; comfort for widows is that the ruin is universal. Give it a try,
&gt; Boris. You have nothing to lose but your rubles.
