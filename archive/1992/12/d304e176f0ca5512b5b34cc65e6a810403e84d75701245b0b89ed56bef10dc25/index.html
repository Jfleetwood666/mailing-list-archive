&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;               The anon.penet.fi Anonymous Server
&gt;               ==================================
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, another anonymous server. Why?  Well, several well-known servers have
&gt; bitten the dust recently. And most of them have served only a very limited
&gt; subset of newsgroups, and mail only to "registered", anonymous users. One
&gt; quite successful attempt at solving this problem was the server running at
&gt; godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu, written and operated by Karl Kleinpaste
&gt; &lt;Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu&gt;. Karl's software has been posted to alt.sources.
&gt; 
&gt; Due to reasons too complicated to mention here I wanted to set up an
&gt; anonymous server for the scandinavian user community. I contacted Karl, and
&gt; got a pre-release copy of his software. As the version I got relied heavily
&gt; on the advanced features of MMDFII, I had to modify it quite a bit. While
&gt; hacking around, I removed the restriction of only supporting selected
&gt; newsgroups. Within a week of startup, the server had been discovered by
&gt; transatlantic users, and more recent stats show european users are definitely
&gt; a minority.
&gt; 
&gt; So what does the anon server really do? Well, it provides a front for
&gt; sending mail messages and posting news items anonymously. As you send your
&gt; very first message to the server, it automatically allocates you an id of
&gt; the form anNNN, and sends you a message containing the allocated id. This id
&gt; is used in all your subsequent anon posts/mails. Any mail messages sent to
&gt; your-id@anon.penet.fi gets redirected to your original, real address. Any
&gt; reply is of course anonymized in the same way, so the server provides a
&gt; double-blind. You will not know the true identity of any user, unless she
&gt; chooses to reveal her identity explicitly.
&gt; 
&gt; In the anonymization process all headers indicating the true originator are
&gt; removed, and an attempt is made to remove any automatically-included
&gt; signatures, by looking for a line starting with two dashes (--), and zapping
&gt; everything from there on. But if your signature starts with anything else,
&gt; it's your own responsibility to remove it from your messages.
&gt; 
&gt; There are two basic ways to use the system. The easiest way is by sending a
&gt; message to recipient@anon.penet.fi:
&gt; 
&gt; 	To: alt.sex.bestiality@anon.penet.fi
&gt; 
&gt; 	To: an9999@anon.penet.fi
&gt; 
&gt; 	To: help@anon.penet.fi
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, in the case of mailing to a known user, you have to use addresses of
&gt; the form user%host.domain@anon.penet.fi, or the pretty obscure source addressing
&gt; construct of @anon.penet.fi:user@host.domain. These constructs are not
&gt; necessarily handled properly by all mail systems, so I strongly recommend the
&gt; "X-Anon-To:" approach in these cases. This works by you sending a message to
&gt; "anon@anon.penet.fi", including a X-Anon-To: header line containing the desired
&gt; recipient. But this really has to be a field in the message header, before the
&gt; first empty line in the message. So:
&gt; 
&gt; 	To: anon@anon.penet.fi
&gt; 	X-Anon-To: alt.sex.needlework,rec.masturbation
&gt; 
&gt; 	To: anon@anon.penet.fi
&gt; 	X-Anon-To: jack@host.bar.edu
&gt; 
&gt; Valid recipients in both cases are fully qualified user addresses in RFC-822
&gt; format (user@host.domain), anon user id's (anNNN), newsgroup names
&gt; (alt.sex.paperclips) or one of the "special" user names of ping, nick, help,
&gt; admin and stat.
&gt; 
&gt; Sending to "ping" causes a short reply to be sent confirming (and
&gt; allocating, if needed) your anon id. "nick" takes the contents of the
&gt; Subject: header and installs it as your nickname. If you have a nickname, it
&gt; appears in the From: header in the anonymized message along with your anon
&gt; id. "help" returns this text, and stat gives some statistics about the
&gt; system. Mail to "anon" goes directly to me unanonymized, and can be used to
&gt; report problems. If you want to send mail to me anonymously, you can use
&gt; "an0".
&gt; 
&gt; When crossposting to several newsgroups, you can list several newsgroups
&gt; separated by commas (no whitespace) as recipients, but this only works using
&gt; the X-Anon-To: header. References: headers do work, so they can (and should)
&gt; be used to maintain reply threads.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah yes, please remember that the posting takes place at my local site, so you
&gt; can only post to groups that are received at penet.fi. I get all "worldwide"
&gt; groups, but various exotic local groups don't make it here. I have gotten
&gt; a couple of comments about permitting anonymous postings to technical groups.
&gt; I can only answer that I believe very firmly that it's not for me to dictate
&gt; how other people ought to behave. Somebody might have a valid reason for
&gt; posting anonymously to a group I might consider "technical". But remember
&gt; anonymous postings are a privilege, and use them accordingly. I believe adult
&gt; human beings can behave responsibly. Please don't let me down.
&gt; 
&gt; As the server was originally intended to be used by scandinavians, it
&gt; includes support for various languages. The system makes an educated guess
&gt; about your local language based on your top level domain. But it can
&gt; misfire. Fortunately the server doesn't (yet) support urdu, swahili or
&gt; basque... Ah, by the way, if you find it doesn't support your local
&gt; language, and you want to volunteer to translate the message files, get in
&gt; touch...
&gt; 
&gt; The user-id database is based on RFC822-ized forms of your originating
&gt; address. This may cause problems for some users, either because their site
&gt; is not properly registered in the name servers, resulting in
&gt; non-deterministic addresses, or because their mail router doesn't hide the
&gt; identity of individual workstations, resulting in different originating
&gt; addresses depending on which workstation you mail from. Talk to your
&gt; administrator. If that doesn't help, let me know, and I will make a manual
&gt; re-mapping.
&gt; 
&gt; You might wonder about the sense of using a server out somewhere, as the
&gt; song goes, "so close to Russia, so far from Japan". Well, the polar bears
&gt; don't mind, and the ice on the cables don't bother too much :-)
&gt; Well, in fact, as we live in a wonderfully networked world, the major delay
&gt; is not going over the atlantic, but my local connection to the Finnish EUnet
&gt; backbone, fuug.fi. Once you reach a well, connected host, such as
&gt; uunet.uu.net, there's a direct SMTP connection to fuug.fi. My connection to
&gt; fuug.fi is currently a polled connection over ISDN, soon to be upgraded to
&gt; on-demand-SMTP/NNTP. But for now, expect a turn-around delay of 2-4 hours for
&gt; trans-atlantic traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yes, then there's the question of confidentiality/security. The service
&gt; runs on one of the 386 boxes in my back room at home, and the machine is not
&gt; directly accessible from the internet. So the only one who can get to the
&gt; database is myself. Well, if the police or the local Secret Service comes
&gt; knocking at my door, with a court order to hand over the database, I might
&gt; comply. But then I might, of course, accidentally delete the file instead of
&gt; copying it... And maybe possibly there could be cases where, if somebody could
&gt; come up with really hard evidence of activities such as blackmail, I could be
&gt; persuaded...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, short of having everyone run a public-key cryptosystem such as PGP,
&gt; there is no way to protect users from malicious administrators. You have to
&gt; trust my personal integrity. Worse, you have to trust the administrators on
&gt; every mail routing machine on the way, as the message only becomes anonymous
&gt; once it reaches my machine. Malicious sysadmins and/or crackers could spy on
&gt; SMTP mail channels, sendmail queues and mail logs. But as there are more
&gt; than 350 messages being anonymized every day, you have to be pretty perverted
&gt; to scan everything...
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing is mail failures. I've had cases of mail routers doing the wrong
&gt; thing with % addresses, "shortcutting" the path to the destination site.
&gt; This could cause your mail to go to the final destination without ever
&gt; touching my server (and thus without getting anonymized). This can be avoided
&gt; by using the X-Anon-To: method.
&gt; 
&gt; And if your return address bounces for some reason (nameservers down,
&gt; temporary configuration failures etc.), the original sender and/or
&gt; postmasters on the way might get error messages showing your true
&gt; identity, and maybe even the full message.
&gt; 
&gt; And crackers are just too clever. Undoubtedly somebody is going to come
&gt; up with some novel method....  Not much I can do about that...
&gt; 
&gt; If you intend to mail/post something that might cost you your job or
&gt; marriage or inheritance, _please_ send a test message first. The software
&gt; has been pretty well tested, but some mailers on the way (and out of my
&gt; control) screw things up. And if you happen to find a problem, _please_ for
&gt; the sake of all the other users, _let me know asap_.
&gt; 
&gt; And _please_ use the appropriate test newsgroups, such as alt.test or
&gt; misc.test. Yes, _you_ might get excited by reading 2000 "This is a test.."
&gt; messages on alt.sex, but I warn you that most psychologists consider this
&gt; rather aberrant...
&gt; 
&gt; And remember this is a service that some people (in groups such as
&gt; alt.sexual.abuse.recovery) _need_. Please don't do anything stupid that
&gt; would force me to close down the service. As I am running my own company,
&gt; there is very little political pressure anyone can put on me, but if
&gt; somebody starts using the system for criminal activities, the authorities
&gt; might be able to order me to shut down the service. I don't particularly
&gt; want to find out, however...
&gt; 
&gt; If you think these instructions are unclear and confusing, you are right. If
&gt; you come up with suggestions for improving this text, please mail me! Remember
&gt; English is my third language...
&gt; 
&gt; Safe postings!
