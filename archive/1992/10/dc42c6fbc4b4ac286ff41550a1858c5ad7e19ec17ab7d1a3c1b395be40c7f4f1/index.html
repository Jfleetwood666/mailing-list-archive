     <span class="n">Lenny</span> <span class="n">stepped</span> <span class="n">back</span><span class="p">.</span>  <span class="n">He</span> <span class="n">wasn</span><span class="s1">'t as terrified as he could have been, 
though his heart rate must have been close to 120 and his mouth was dry. 
He had been through raid drills and a few real confrontations with the 
law at pickets and bleed-ins. 

     "At least it isn'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">search</span> <span class="n">warrant</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">we</span> <span class="n">might</span> <span class="n">keep</span> <span class="n">operating</span><span class="s2">" he 
thought.  Then remembering the drill, spoke up: 

     "</span><span class="n">Can</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">see</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">order</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="s2">"  

     The beefy one handed it over while his three leaner and younger 
companions fanned out to the computers.  They obviously knew where the 
computers were, but that did not necessarily mean rot in the 
organization.  How well they coped with the 'puters would say something 
about that. 

     The paper was about what he expected, an order signed by a judge to 
copy every storage device in the GreenRage's office to an encrypted WORM 
drive.  The box for paper documents wasn't checked, so they knew they 
wouldn't find anything useful on paper.  Bad sign, it meant they knew 
more about GreenRage than Lenny liked.  "</span><span class="n">Waste</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">much</span> <span class="n">time</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">can</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" 
Lenny thought to himself, and in a very polite voice he asked:

     "Its been turned off in the last 2 minutes.  Did you do it when we

hoping that Stel would hear him in the bathroom, then spoke up even 
louder,

     <span class="n">Beefy</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">whose</span><span class="s1">' badge claimed to be one Dan Barker, and technoid #1 
(Lenny never did get a name for him, flashed their badges. Lenny grabbed 
a whiteboard marker (almost dry, and the only non computer writing device 
permitted in the office) and scribbled Barker'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">badge</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="n">on</span>

kitchen one came back shaking his head. 

     "No damn keyboard or display on the server.  Have to go in through 
the other ones to dump the disk." 

     Technoid #2 moved the mouse on Marge'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">machine</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">thank</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">green</span>

screen was still alive.  He hit the space bar, and pulled out a little 
alarm timer which he set to go off every 3 minutes. "Damn, damnit" 
thought Lenny, "I should have set the timeout shorter, has it really been 
less than 5 minutes since I got up?"  And he was mentally kicking himself 
for not wiping the password when he got up. 

     Technoid #3 noted the directory (ACIDRAIN/TRMINATE) where Lenny had 
been working and went back up, a level at a time to the main directory on 
the file server.  He seemed prepared to deal with a no printer machine, 
pulling out a pad of paper from a little portfolio (more trees!) and 
started making notes on the directory structure. 

     Technoid #2 looked up from Marge'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">machine</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">asked</span> <span class="n">Lenny</span><span class="p">,</span> 

     <span class="s2">"I don't suppose you would know the password?"</span> 

     <span class="n">Lenny</span> <span class="n">shook</span> <span class="n">his</span> <span class="n">head</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="n">looked</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">agent</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">eye</span><span class="p">.</span>

     <span class="s2">"No sir! I certainly wouldn't know Marge's password to get into her 
personal machine!"</span> <span class="k">And</span> <span class="n">wouldn</span><span class="s1">'t admit it if I did know, he thought. 

     Technoid #2 looked over at Stel frowning at the machine on her desk 
and asked mildly, 

    "I don'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">suppose</span> <span class="n">you</span> <span class="n">would</span> <span class="n">remember</span> <span class="n">your</span> <span class="n">password</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="s2">" 

    "</span><span class="n">Fuck</span> <span class="n">off</span> <span class="n">sharp</span> <span class="n">one</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" Stel said with a straight face.  Even in a near 
state of panic, Lenny got a flash of amusement as Beefy started to spit 
out a hot reply.  Beefy checked himself as he saw #2 write down 
fuckoff#1.  Stel grinned slightly; she had almost scored one on the 
agents. 

    Without making a move toward Stel's machine, #2 asked #3, 

    "</span><span class="n">Shall</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">try</span> <span class="n">it</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Jim</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="s2">"  Jim was engrossed, paging through directories 
but he mumbled: 

    "</span><span class="n">No</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">let</span><span class="s1">'s see what I can get before we risk a password given under 
duress." And, half a minute later, 

    "This is going to be a bitch, I can'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">find</span> <span class="n">any</span> <span class="n">programs</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">dump</span>

grinned, and straightened his face with an effort.  The crypt program had 
come with instructions to delete or encrypt under a special key a long 
list of compilers and interpreters-- not that he understood exactly what 
they were anyway. 

     "</span><span class="n">Bob</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">could</span> <span class="n">you</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">one</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">uniformed</span> <span class="n">officers</span> <span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">camera</span>

<span class="n">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"  Beefy went to the door and tried to get the attention of one of 
the uniformed cops that had come with them.  No luck, they were both out 
back, keeping an eye on the building power switch so no one could turn it 
off.  It was less distance to the car, so he just walked out to the car, 
rummaged around in the back seat and brought back the camera kit.  Jim 
waited for him, typing a space every 3 minutes. 

     "</span><span class="n">Take</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">easy</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">polaroid</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">damn</span> <span class="n">film</span> <span class="n">costs</span> <span class="n">two</span> <span class="n">dollars</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">shot</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" 
as he handed the camera kit to technoid #3.  Technoid #2 came over to 
help and started clicking shots of the screen as Jim worked his way 
around in the directory tree.  There were *lots* of interesting directory 
and file names.  Stel, Marge, and the three masked visitors from back 
east had spent a whole evening making up provocative names like HIT_LIST 
(Lenny's address book), and $LAUNDRY (data for a spreadsheet program 
Marge used), and a lot of disaster names like HINDENBG, and TEX_CITY.  
Since the crypt program left the directories in the clear, they thought 
they might as well make them amusing.  At the moment, with cold sweat 
dripping down his back, Lenny wished he had made the directories a little 
*less* provocative. 

     Once in a while, technoid #3 or Jim as Lenny was beginning to use to 
identify him--gotta scribble that name on the white board--would give the 
command to type out a file to the screen.  He either got a mess of 
published material from decade-old anarchist newsletters, some of which 
they carefully photographed on the screen, or computer-generated random 
bytes (which, of course, they thought was encrypted material).  One or 
the other of the technoids not sitting at the screen kept themselves 
shielding the power switch and plug.  Stel was sitting on the grubby 
couch waiting for the technoids to either break into the system or screw 
up.  Lenny went over and joined her, feeling miserable about the agents 
getting in through _his_ system and unwilling to watch any more and give 
away by body language when they were about to trip.  He glanced at his 
watch.  The damn cron program should ask for the password in another 20 
minutes.  "</span><span class="n">Jeez</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" he thought, "</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">hope</span> <span class="n">they</span> <span class="n">don</span><span class="s1">'t get anything."  

     "There are _10_ copies of something which looks like a word processor 
on the server hard drive--they all have the same byte count and date, and 
there is _NO_ '</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="s1">' set," technoid #3 bitched loudly enough for Lenny to 
hear.  (Happened that this was an accident.   Lenny had found that if he 
copied the word processor into each directory he made, it worked fine.)  
The server had an old 700 Mbyte drive, and a few copies more or less of a half 
Meg program made no big difference.  However at the moment, the technoids 
had concluded that this was a clever hack, that the system would wipe the 
password out of memory if they tried to run the wrong word processor 
program.  They outfoxed themselves: any one of them would have worked 
fine.  ("Type" or "copy" to the screen wouldn'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">work</span> <span class="n">because</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">WD</span><span class="p">*</span><span class="m">11.0</span>

     <span class="s2">"Well, Bob, it is moment of truth time.  We can take a 1 in 10 
chance of starting up the word processor and looking at the files, or we 
can try to load in a program to extract the key from this thing's 
stinking memory.  What say?"</span> 

     <span class="s2">"You guys are the experts, don't ask me."</span> 

     <span class="n">After</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">short</span> <span class="n">conference</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">technoid</span> <span class="p">#</span><span class="m">3</span> <span class="n">fished</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">diskette</span> <span class="n">out</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">his</span>

    "Here goes nothing." and he typed "dir a:".  The crypt program was 
watching for diskette access, and came back with: 

                  "I NEED A PASSWORD! 

     "Shit."  whispered a dejected technoid under his breath.  "Know 
anybody at NSA?" 

---------------- 
   
     Lenny put the back of his palmtop on the microphone of a payphone 
and hit the dial button. 

     "That will be one dollar for the first minute." 

     Bong, bong, bong, bong. 

     "Thank you for using ESJI, you have one minute."  Buzz-click, 

     "Hello, there is no one here at the moment, but you can record a 
message."

     "Here" was a little module of code in an automated PBX/voice mail 
machine watching for incoming calls after working hours on a line deep in 
the list of numbers assigned to a small corporation.  It was an old 
machine, and unlikely to get another software upgrade.  After taking a 
call, it would not take another for several hours, and it rotated through 
several recorded messages.

     Lenny hit the next button down on the palmtop.

     #-Beep, 4-Beep, 3-Beep, 6-Beep.

     "confirm with password.
  
     L-beep, E-beep, N-beep.

     "Record message.  End with any key."
 
     Beeeeep. 

     "Nancy, its Murray, just called to say hi.  Get back to me sometime 
when you get a chance."  #-beep. 

    "Message confirmation number 36, repeat 36," and a click.
         
     The PBX made a local call to a paging company and transmitted what 
looked like a phone number.  The phone number digits added up to 36.

     Lenny punched 36 into his palmtop and hit the enter key.  It came up 
with an address, a description, and a phone number.  It was the phone  
next to the K-mart entrance about a mile away. 

    "K-mart will be closing about the time I get over there," he thought. 
"Could have taken the bike."  He closed the palmtop.  It sensed the 
closing and erased its encryption password. 

     Lenny got back in his tiny 5 year old "B-car," the 60 mpg car some 
rich dude had been force to take in a package deal when he bought a 20 
mpg Lincoln Towncar.  He twisted the key.  The lights dimmed as the 
catalytic convertor came back up to heat on the battery.  There was a few

     Lenny related the events of the afternoon up to the point where the 
agents lost the password on his machine by trying to load a memory dump

just like it, and even made me choose which one I got.  The order said I 
was required to take one of them.  It has all kinds of legal seals and 
signatures on it.  They said take it to our lawyer.  One of us took it 
over about 5 pm.  None of us have a way to read it.  Are we in trouble?"  

     There was quite a delay.  Then, the digital voice spoke up. 

     "Even if they were able to track me down, *I* am not in trouble. I

of the line went on.

was filled with the nastiest old published stuff we could find--rabid 
libertarian literature and anarchist newsletters, public domain stuff off 
a CD ROM. The rest was filled with random numbers from a noise card when 
your guy set it up last year, then we deleted about half of it to give us 
working space.  But far as I know, there was nothing to worry about in 
the clear.  Snooper hasn'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">been</span> <span class="n">complaining</span> <span class="n">about</span> <span class="n">unencrypted</span> <span class="n">files</span> <span class="n">when</span>

     Lenny and Marge checked into a motel which had definitely seen 
better times, but was happy to take cash.  A lot of people had quit using 
credit cards, especially for checking into a motel on the hourly plan.  
It was just too easy for people to tap into credit card records.  The 
swimming pool was dry in July, but what the heck, they weren'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">here</span> <span class="n">for</span>

     <span class="s2">"Lenny, this place was built before they invented grounding plugs, 
what do you expect."</span> 

     <span class="s2">"Well, what the heck are we going to do now?"</span> 

     <span class="s2">"First we look around.  No problem, the socket in the bathroom is a

     <span class="s2">"They're after someone else.  I've read about some of the events

     <span class="n">That</span> <span class="n">wasn</span><span class="p">`</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">entirely</span> <span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">.</span>  <span class="n">One</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="s2">"events"</span> <span class="n">was</span> <span class="n">one</span> <span class="n">Lenny</span> <span class="n">had</span> 
<span class="n">put</span> <span class="n">together</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">when</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">didn</span><span class="s1">'t come off within a year, he had decided 
they had chickened out.  Since the project he had put together took out 
much of an oil refinery, he was not surprised.  Industrial sabotage on 
that scale took more than a little guts.  When the plant finally blew up, 
Lenny watched the papers for weeks, but never found out if it was ruled 
accidental.  The feds did not seem to be sure either, they only mentioned 
it as a possibility.  The other accusations were split between cases 
where Lenny strongly suspected sister organization had done the deed, or 
industrial accidents where some organization had taken credit for what 
was probably an accident. 

     Back in court Bruce complained to the judge that there was nothing 
substantial in the affidavit supporting the DSO, and that while his 
client did not have anything to hide, the government was asking to break 
into the confidential business records of a public interest group.  And 
if they would not just forget the whole thing, he wanted more time to 
respond.

     The US Attorney would have asked for more time to respond if Bruce 
had not, so he was agreeable.  The clerk set a date for 6 weeks off.
                                                  
--------

     Lenny was paralyzed from the neck down.  The judge was asking him 
for the password, and he could not remember it.  The bailiff, clerk, 
Bruce and Mulroony were all talking in a huddle and he could not make 
sense out of anything they said, no matter how hard he tried.  

    "This will do it!" one of them said, and jammed a furry dead fish 
under his nose. 

    Lenny found he could move as he pushed it away.  He woke up to find 
the cat had been licking his face and smelling of fish flavored cat food. 
                                
    5:14 AM.  "There isn'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">much</span> <span class="n">point</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">trying</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">back</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nf">sleep</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" he 
thought but Lenny flopped back on the bed.  The cat started to purr and 
kneed the covers.  Lenny absently rubbed its head, and thought about the 
next fundraising letter.  The DSO had had the effect of galvanizing the 
GreenRage membership, so donations were way up, and for the first time in 
several years, there was more than just a little money in the bank 
account of GreenRage.  Of course, it was flowing out almost as fast.  
Even though Bruce charged about half the going lawyer rate to public 
interest organiztions, fighting the DSO was going to cost them a bundle.  
"</span><span class="n">Just</span> <span class="n">how</span> <span class="n">much</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">stuff</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">disk</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">going</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">cause</span> <span class="n">trouble</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"  
Lenny realized he had spoken outloud.  If they asked for a special 
master, the membership list could be declared off limits.  Unlike the old 
days, when the cops could look through outgoing mail at the post office, 
an electronic mail list was fairly secure.  

     There wasn't much of interest in the finantial records either.  Oh, 
a few thousands spent for sabatage material would be hard to account for 
if they really dug into it, but the bulk of the money was spent on 
saleries, office supplies, rent, and telecom charges.  They could always 
claim the money was spent on spray cans and ceramic spikes for trees.  
And we can say we spent it for dope.  Lenny grinned at this one.  He had 
given up smoking dope, made him too paranoid.  But, every fall some 
unknown but appreciated benifactor sent the office a plastic tub of the 
stickyest buds you could imagine. Perhaps one of their above ground 
efforts had saved some trees screening the "</span><span class="n">crop</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"   Marge and Stel had 
split the tub the last two years. 

   The problem was not the lastest project.  Nor was it the one or two a 
month Lenny had put together over the last 3 years.  They were long 
perged, and the disk space overwritten.  And he didn't worry about the 
contents of the newletters.  Presumably *somebody* on the list was a 
ringer, and the cops had a collection of *The GreenFlag.*  What woke 
Lenny up in the middle of the night (besides his cat) was the stuff which 
they had on that WORM disk which *had not yet happened*.  He could 
probably get away with claiming that the files on the events which had 
happened were interactive fiction based on news stories.  Or could he?  
Nope, the damn files are dated prior to the "</span><span class="n">events</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" he thought.  And, 
even though fewer than half of the projects he had worked on ever came 
off, there were at least three or four of them they could nail me on.  

   Lenny turned the light on and pulled his palmtop out of the charging 
stand next to the bed.  He stretched the keyboard out to full size and 
set there trying to put his thoughts in order.  After entering his 
password, he brought up an organizer program.  It prompted:  State the 
problem. 

    "</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">don</span><span class="s1">'t want to go to jail for conspiricy.  The only way to stay out 
of jail is to keep the cops from looking through the GreenRage computer 
files.  Or is it?   If they can'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">convence</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">judge</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">they</span> <span class="n">need</span> <span class="k">to</span>

<span class="n">asking</span> <span class="n">me</span> <span class="n">for</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">password</span><span class="p">.</span>  <span class="n">Assuming</span> <span class="n">they</span> <span class="n">can</span><span class="s1">'t crack the encryption-- 
which seems likely.  If I give it, I go to jail, if I don'</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">may</span> <span class="n">get</span> 
<span class="n">jailed</span> <span class="n">for</span> <span class="n">contempt</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">unless</span> <span class="n">they</span> <span class="n">give</span> <span class="n">me</span> <span class="n">blanket</span> <span class="n">immunity</span><span class="p">.</span>  <span class="k">In</span> <span class="n">either</span>

    The organizer program came up with: 

    You have used one or more legal terms.  We recommend you submit your 
completed outline to a lawyer. 

    It then proceeded to break the statements into an if-then-else logic 
tree which did not help Lenny much either.
