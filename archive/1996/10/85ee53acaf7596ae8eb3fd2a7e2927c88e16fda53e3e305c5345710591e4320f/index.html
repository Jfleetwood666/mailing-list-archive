Jean-Francois Avon asked me to forward this to the list. It is part of 
a conversation that He and I had last week. 

The Crypto Relevance if any is in the attitudes we are discussing, and 
in the the last couple paragraphs of Mr. Avon's writing.

&gt; &gt; When I talked about driving for 48 hours straight, I was trying to
&gt; &gt; impart an idea that many midwestern people are rasied with, the
&gt; &gt; total VASTNESS of the world. We (midwesterners, and some of the
&gt; &gt; westerners, and a lot of older people (in their 60's &amp; 70's)
&gt; &gt; honestly believe deep down inside that this country is too vast to
&gt; &gt; effectively control that the government simply CAN'T do it. They
&gt; &gt; can't enforce any control they wish to have with the army, because
&gt; &gt; WE have guns, and a lot of us are ex-army (a little older, a
&gt; &gt; little slower, a HELL of a lot more devious and a lot less
&gt; &gt; impetuious&lt;sp&gt;). We simply don't accept the fact that any one CAN
&gt; &gt; control us.
&gt; 
&gt; This might be why I liked NM, and AZ and TX.  I can understand the 
&gt; feeling you describe as you can barely escape it while visiting the 
&gt; place.  I suppose our canadian politicians also understood that: c.f. 
&gt; Bill C-68 :(
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, [the person's] point was that [some type of software] took
&gt; &gt; control and decesions out of peoples hands, and that is why it was
&gt; &gt; a market sucess. This I see as a European disease, the looking to
&gt; &gt; government &amp; the church for the solutions to every day problems.
&gt; 
&gt; That is the feudalist attitude and philosophy.  Absolutely
&gt; disgusting.  Although we have, here in Quebec, french roots and
&gt; civil laws based on the Napoleon Code (Common Law everywhere in
&gt; Canada except in QC), the population have a very american way of
&gt; seeing life. Every time I have political discussion with French from
&gt; France, the feudal mentality always surfaces up and I always have
&gt; problems with them.  They have a hierarchy-worshiping attitude,
&gt; coupled with an abdication of the power of their own reason (at the
&gt; individual level).  In short, they are brought-up to become yes-men. 
&gt; It litterally gives me an uncomfortable feeling in my guts. 
&gt; Disgusting.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The original Colonists didn't have that attitude (well, they did to
&gt; &gt; some degree, but not the people on the edges) In fact the attitude
&gt; &gt; really didn't develop fully in this country until the 1920's, and
&gt; &gt; still hasn't caught on everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; Roosevelt and his New Deal...  I got the chance to find a magazine
&gt; who explained how the Federal Reserve was created.  Politicians
&gt; sneaking into trains as "duck hunters", grand political socialistic
&gt; schemes sprung on peoples in secret, etc.  The magazine did not say
&gt; that but I am leaning on the Objectivist side and I tend to read
&gt; what *is* written...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; politicians started paying for votes with government largess
&gt; 
&gt; As a 70 years old englishmen, ex-company managing president &amp; very
&gt; friend of mine once said: Everyday, they buy us with our own money...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; These two attitudes are pretty diametrically opposed, but coupled
&gt; &gt; it with a school system that doesn't encourage extra-curriculer
&gt; &gt; thought, and you have some pretty incosistent people. 
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, you are absolutely right.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [slight topic drift...] I was wondering lately...  Words have a lot
&gt; of power.  They are the building blocks we use to materialize
&gt; concepts.  Think about the word "Government".  You would think of it
&gt; as a body that governs.  But the american peoples think the
&gt; government ought to be a body that acts under a mandate to
&gt; administrate and oversee certain things.  
&gt; 
&gt; The very word "govt" seems to (conceptually) almost "justify" the
&gt; actions of present govts, while any other word (like, for example,
&gt; "overseers", "Mandated", etc) would stress out that they are under 
&gt; *our* orders (and nowadays, exceeding their mandate).
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe we should start using a new word to describe *exactly" what it
&gt; is that they ought to be doing.  Doing so would also stress out 
&gt; *exactly* what they are pulling on us...
