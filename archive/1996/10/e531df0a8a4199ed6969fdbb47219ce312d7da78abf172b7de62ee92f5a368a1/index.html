&gt; &gt; [challenging wiretap laws]
&gt; &gt; &gt;And we seasoned lawyers, three of us last I counted, told you that you
&gt; &gt; &gt;were an idiot for suggesting it.  I guess we hurt your feelings because
&gt; &gt; &gt;you turned around and asked for a "civilized" lawyer.  (Read: one who will
&gt; &gt; &gt;listen to your ranting).  You wanted a legal opinion, you got more than
&gt; &gt; &gt;one. Now go away.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; look, I was not going to rub this in your face at all, but you don't
&gt; &gt; seem to have a clue about this. the fact that you/others here can't 
&gt; &gt; scrounge enough imagination to come up with an attack against wiretap laws 
&gt; &gt; based on case law and think such a think is a waste of time
&gt; &gt; is pretty meaningless in your case. I don't think
&gt; &gt; you have an imaginative bone in your body, hence the great vitriol
&gt; &gt; that you unleash upon me whenever I use my own.
&gt; 
&gt; Well "Vlad," as the most creative lawyer on the list, it seems it's up
&gt; to you to get us out of this mess we are in.  I'm certainly not biting the
&gt; bait and researching the topic for you because you call me unimaginative.



Given all the members of so-called "Organized Crime" who have been 
convicted using wiretaps, we must assume that all of their lawyers were 
similarly unimaginative.

Don't tell Don Vito!




&gt; 
&gt; Clearly no one on the list cares.  Perhaps you should look elsewhere for
&gt; your support (hint hint).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; from the article just recently posted:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/examiner/article.cgi?year=1996&amp;month=10&amp;day=06&amp;art
&gt; &gt; &gt;icle=BUSINESS2814.dtl
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Encryption controversy pits life against liberty
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;"Wiretapping is the main issue," said Stewart Baker, former general counsel
&gt; &gt; &gt;of the National Security Agency, the CIA's code-breaking and eavesdroping
&gt; &gt; &gt;cousin.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; as TCM just pointed out, this is a departure on the part of the administration
&gt; &gt; in describing the tactics of clipper. clearly, WIRETAPPING AUTHORITY IS
&gt; &gt; KEY TO CLIPPER LEGITIMACY. hence a legal challenge to wiretapping is an
&gt; &gt; extremely critical angle to the situation.
&gt; 
&gt; "Newtonian Science is the KEY TO TRAVEL TO THE MOON.  Hence a challenge to
&gt; newtonian Science is an extremely critical angle to the situation.
&gt; 
&gt; Note the similarities.  1&gt; We've already been to the moon.  2&gt; Newtonian
&gt; Science is unlikely to be argued away in a way that will negate moon
&gt; travel any time soon.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand that it's difficult for you to grasp how firmly entrenched
&gt; the concept of wiretapping is in law enforcement, courts and the
&gt; legislature, and that your novel new approach has been tried before.
&gt; Part of the reason its hard for you to understand is because you haven't
&gt; bothered to go check.  Instead you have to look for civil libertarian
&gt; lawyers to try and say what you can't because you haven't looked.
&gt; 
&gt; You repeating your claim over and over again isn't going to get me to lift
&gt; a finger to research it for you.  You've been given several suggestions as
&gt; to where to look to show the massive holes in your claim in about five
&gt; minutes.  I think if you were to give it a try you would redden quite
&gt; quickly on realizing how hard us "imaginationless" lawyers were laughing
&gt; at you all this time.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;"If two criminals are discussing a plot over the telephone and we have a
&gt; &gt; &gt;wiretap order, the encryption would negate the wiretap," said Michael
&gt; &gt; &gt;Vatis, a senior Department of Justice official.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;"For serious investigations involving terrorists or organized crime . . .
&gt; &gt; &gt;where you're worried about hundreds of people being killed . . . the whole
&gt; &gt; &gt;point is to keep the investigation secret or the whole thing blows up," he
&gt; &gt; &gt;said.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; as I just recently wrote, it seems to me one of the key points of discussion
&gt; &gt; that is just now emerging in this debate is the demand by the gov't
&gt; &gt; that wiretapping be done IN SECRET without knowledge of the suspect,
&gt; 
&gt; This is nothing new "Vlad."  It's been a point of contention for over 50
&gt; years and a well settled one for the last 25-30.  Go look it up.
&gt; 
&gt; I also call upon you to look at the sources of these claims.  Stewart
&gt; Baker, now at Steptoe and Johnson, formerly of the NSA, heard speaking at
&gt; the ABA Conference on Law Enforcement and Intelligence.  Michael Vatis,
&gt; also heard speaking at the ABA Conference, sidekick of Gorelick and young
&gt; shining star in the Justice Department.  These are the people who will
&gt; benefit from associating wiretap and crypto because wiretap is extremely
&gt; unlikely to be challenged as an investigative tool in any way shape or
&gt; form.  These are the arguments of the law enforcement side.
&gt; 
&gt; You are shooting crypto in the foot if you allow wiretapping into the
&gt; argument.  You are doing more damage than good.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; whereas civil libertarians seem to be challenging this point in particular.
&gt; &gt; it could be a magic bullet it defeating wiretapping. it seems to really
&gt; &gt; get to the core of the debate about key escrow etc.
&gt; 
&gt; No, what gets to the core of the debate about key escrow is whether strong
&gt; encryption which does not comply will be made illegal to possess or use.
&gt; This is a meaningless detour and a waste of time.  So much so that I
&gt; wonder if you are not working for some local agency (I say local because
&gt; your posts are simply not crafty enough to be any kind of concerted
&gt; disinformation attempt on the part of authorities with wider briefs).
&gt; 
&gt; Meaningful attempts to derail Clipper will come along the same lines they
&gt; always have.  Economic objections made by industry and challenges to
&gt; thinly stretched regulations like ITAR which have been untested in the
&gt; vein before.  Revamping the country's entire wiretap law is not only a far
&gt; fetched project, its nearly a wild goose chase.  Please take it elsewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;Not so, argued Daniel Weitzner, an attorney with the civil libertarian
&gt; &gt; &gt;Center for Democracy and Technology inWashington, D.C. Forgetting
&gt; &gt; &gt;encryption for a moment, Weitzner said, a wiretap is unlike any other tool
&gt; &gt; &gt;in the
&gt; &gt; &gt;investigator's arsenal.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;"To get documents sitting on my computer, the FBI has to come into my
&gt; &gt; &gt;office with a search warrant," Weitzner said. "I have to know about it."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the same distinction again. very interesting.  I was just emphasizing
&gt; &gt; that in my post.
&gt; 
&gt; Notice, however, that he doesn't suggest trying to overturn the wiretap
&gt; laws to get at Clipper.  Same distinction there too.
&gt; 
&gt; Law enforcement says "We need this power" attorneys with the Center for
&gt; Democracy and Technology (which by the way, while "Vlad" respects in
&gt; terms of legal prowess, I do not) whine "But they never should have
&gt; gotten wiretap technology in the first place."
&gt; 
&gt; You really thing that's a positive argument?  Go for it.  Dedicate your
&gt; life to the subject.  You have all my encouragement.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;Exactly the reverse is true for a wiretap. To be effective, the subject
&gt; &gt; &gt;must be ignorant of the tap. Weitzner said this
&gt; &gt; &gt;notion of a "secret search" went against a central principle of the Fourth
&gt; &gt; &gt;Amendment, which protects people from
&gt; &gt; &gt;unreasonable search and seizure.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; whoa, apparently this would be news to Unicorn, who thinks it would be
&gt; &gt; a waste of time to argue against the established legitimacy of wiretapping
&gt; &gt; and considers himself a premiere lawyer-dude.  well, I'll just let Unicorn
&gt; &gt; argue with Weitzner, (whose credentials are rather impressive and I 
&gt; &gt; trust more, btw..)  I'd be interested to hear what Weitzner says, 
&gt; &gt; Uni...
&gt; 
&gt; I won't be talking to Weitzner obviously.  It a losing man's argument.
&gt; "We wouldn't be in the mess we are in now if the Supreme Court hadn't
&gt; gelded the 4th amendment in the early years of its development."
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck.
&gt; 
&gt; If Weitzner's credentials are so impressive, why isn't he in private
&gt; practice where the big money and influence are?  That's where Stewart
&gt; Baker is.  That's where Gorelick is heading.  That's where Freeh is
&gt; headed, and it's what Vatis will be up to in 3 years time.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; so what we have here is a very knowledgeable lawyer who has helped
&gt; &gt; out EFF argue that wiretaps are unconstitutional based on the precise
&gt; &gt; aspect that I was focusing on in a post that Unicorn flamed me for:
&gt; &gt; that they are secret, unknown to the suspect,
&gt; &gt; and that this thereby might constitute an "unreasonable"
&gt; &gt; search and seizure. I don't claim to have originated this of course, but
&gt; &gt; I was emphasizing it in my post, and Unicorn objected.
&gt; 
&gt; Then it seems you should take the discussion to the great legal mind of
&gt; our times, Weitzner, rather than waste our time and bandwidth with it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; reading what Weitzner wrote, it is not inconceivable to imagine
&gt; &gt; him having the position that wiretaps in their present form might
&gt; &gt; not survive a court challenge, i.e. it would at least not be
&gt; &gt; a waste of time to mount such a case, as Unicorn belligerently
&gt; &gt; bellows above is obvious to anyone with a smidgeon of legal
&gt; &gt; background..
&gt; 
&gt; So call him and foster such a challenge "Vlad."
&gt; 
&gt; I'm anxious to hear about your progress.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, speaking of which, what happened to your super-clever ISP encrypts
&gt; every peices of mail that comes in idea?  I don't see it mentioned here.
