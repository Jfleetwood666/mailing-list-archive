&gt;     INTERNET BEWARE: GOVERNMENTS ARE SMELLING A RICH NEW SOURCE OF TAXES
&gt;   __________________________________________________________________________

&gt;      Copyright &amp;copy 1996 The Boston Globe
      
&gt;   (Sep 25, 1996 8:06 p.m. EDT) If taxes are the price we pay for
&gt;   civilization, the Internet is about to become a lot more civilized.
&gt;   State and local governments are coming to see on-line computer
&gt;   networks as a rich, new revenue source, and they want to cash in.
   
&gt;   An official of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue said this month
&gt;   on-line service providers that do business in the state should be
&gt;   paying a 5 percent sales tax. Those who haven't been paying could face
&gt;   audits, penalties and demands for back taxes.
   
&gt;   The state of Tennessee has demanded on-line services doing business
&gt;   there turn over their tax records and a count of how many customers
&gt;   they have in the state. Cities in Texas and Colorado are considering
&gt;   special on-line taxes. And a recent effort to slap a 6 percent tax on
&gt;   Internet users in Tacoma, Wash., aroused so much public outrage that
&gt;   city officials were forced to back off.
   
&gt;   Many Internet experts agree that Internet taxes are inevitable. After
&gt;   all, connecting computers to the Internet is now a $2 billion
&gt;   business, and people use these networks to buy and sell millions of
&gt;   dollars in goods and services.
   
[...]

&gt;   But some also fear the chaos that could result as 50 state governments
&gt;   and thousands of cities and counties each make their own rules about
&gt;   taxing computer networks and the transactions that occur on them.
   
&gt;   The issue may be given new prominence, thanks to a surprising decision
&gt;   by a major Internet service provider. In late August, Netcom On-Line
&gt;   Communication Services Inc. began notifying its Massachusetts
&gt;   customers the company would start adding the state's 5 percent sales
&gt;   tax to its bills. Netcom typically charges $19.95 a month for a
&gt;   personal Internet account, so the tax would amount to $1. Similar
&gt;   notices were sent to Netcom customers in several other states,
&gt;   including Illinois and Pennsylvania.
   
&gt;   Did the taxing authorities in these states demand their money? Guess
&gt;   again. Netcom has decided to begin paying the taxes voluntarily.
&gt;   Thomas Weatherford, Netcom's chief financial officer, said its
&gt;   accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young, warned them early this year that
&gt;   Netcom might be liable for the taxes.
   
[...]
   
&gt;   So Netcom contacted state tax officials for clarification. Netcom's
&gt;   500,000 customers are scattered throughout the United States, but the
&gt;   company is focusing on tax laws in Massachusetts and 14 other states
&gt;   where most of its customers dwell. Weatherford said he still had
&gt;   received no official word from Massachusetts, but Netcom attorneys had
&gt;   concluded the company is subject to the state's telecommunication
&gt;   sales tax. To play it safe, it will begin collecting the tax this
&gt;   month.

	Remind me not to sign up with Netcom.
   
&gt;   It's probably a smart move. At the Massachusetts Department of
&gt;   Revenue, acting general counsel William Hazel told the Globe that
&gt;   Netcom and every other on-line service provider should be paying the
&gt;   sales tax.
   
&gt;   "To the extent that folks are being charged for the ability to
&gt;   telecommunicate through the Internet... that's taxable," he said.
   
&gt;   This situation could change. The state has set up a legislative
&gt;   commission to review its telecommunications tax policy, with a final
&gt;   report due next year. But for now, Hazel said, Massachusetts wants its
&gt;   money, including back taxes from up to seven years ago. Hazel said
&gt;   some Internet access providers are paying the tax already.
   
&gt;   But plenty of others are not. For example, Kristopher Hill, president
&gt;   of NetWorx Internet Services Inc. in Newburyport, said he believed his
&gt;   firm didn't have to pay sales tax in any of the dozen states in which
&gt;   it operates. He wasn't thrilled to hear that he may be wrong. "If we
&gt;   have to start dealing with Chicago tax law, that'll be a major pain in
&gt;   my butt," he said. Chicago imposes a tax on telecommunications
&gt;   services over and above the Illinois state tax.
   
&gt;   Hill is even more annoyed by the prospect of being ordered to pay
&gt;   years of back sales taxes in Massachusetts. He said state officials
&gt;   never told Internet service providers they were liable for the money,
&gt;   and to try to collect it now would be unfair. "We would sooner leave
&gt;   the commonwealth than be subjected to seemingly arbitrary and
&gt;   ill-defined taxes," Hill said.
   
[...]

&gt;   Netcom's Weatherford opposes taxes on Internet services but says if
&gt;   his company pays voluntarily, tax officials should demand payment from
&gt;   Netcom's competitors. That could mean trouble for America's 3,700
&gt;   Internet service providers, many of which are shoestring operations
&gt;   that will have to set up tax collection procedures.

	Translation: Netcom is attempting to use regulations to shut
down its competitors.
   
&gt;   The fuss over Internet service taxes is just the beginning. Another
&gt;   sticky controversy awaits: How do you tax sales of goods and services
&gt;   over the Internet?
   
[...]

&gt;   And then there's the question of which government is entitled to
&gt;   collect the tax. Say you log on to Ohio-based CompuServe, where you
&gt;   buy a fruit basket from a firm in California and have it sent to your
&gt;   mother in Chicago. Which state gets to collect tax on the transaction?
&gt;   The experts say right now, the answer is unclear.

	If they think that's "unclear", wait until they start dealing with
multinational transactions....
   
&gt;   But tax-hungry governments are hard at work trying to figure it all
&gt;   out. According to KPMG Peat Marwick, sales of goods and services over
&gt;   the Internet will reach $125 billion by the year 2000. One way or
&gt;   another, governments intend to get their share.

	Note the typical biased phrasing.
