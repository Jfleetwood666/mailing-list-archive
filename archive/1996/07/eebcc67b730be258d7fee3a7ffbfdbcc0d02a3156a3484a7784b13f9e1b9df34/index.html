&gt;(MISSI)
&gt;                               Identification and Authentication (I&amp;A) Forum
&gt;                                          3 June 1996, Meeting Minutes
&gt;
&gt;     The theme of this I&amp;A Forum was security for the World Wide Web (WWW). 
&gt; The following was the agenda for the meeting:
&gt;
&gt; -    Introduction - Dave Luddy, National Security Agency (NSA)
&gt; -    Web Technology Overview - Dave Dodge, NSA
&gt; -    INTELINK Security Needs - Susanne Rosewell, ISMC
&gt; -    Mitre Corporate Experiences Using The Web (An Information Security 
&gt;[INFOSEC] Point Of View) - Michael Louden, Mitre
&gt; -     Security Policy Summary - Dale Hapeman, Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton
&gt; -    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)/Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) 
&gt;Secure   Web Standard Activities - Judy Furlong, Mitre
&gt; -   Netscape and Web Security - Frank Hecker, Netscape
&gt; -   Protecting Web Sites From Attack - Dr. Rick Smith,  Secure Computing 
&gt;Corporation
&gt; -   Security products For WWW Applications - Mike Zauzig, SecureWare
&gt; -   WWW Access (Attempting Solutions) - Dale Hapeman, Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton
&gt; -   Forum Wrap-up - Dave Luddy, NSA
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Dave Luddy, the Forum Chairperson, opened the meeting with an 
&gt;overview of the forum.  He discussed:
&gt; -   The goal of the forum is "to insure the commercial availability of 
&gt;affordable I&amp;A solutions that meet our customer's security, performance, 
&gt;interoperability, and security management needs."
&gt; -   The focus is on MISSI FORTEZZA based solutions.
&gt; -   The development of an I&amp;A Concept Of Operations (CONOPS) will be used as 
&gt;the means of capturing I&amp;A requirements for WWW access and other network 
&gt;applications.
&gt; -   The forum participants and modus operandi are documented in the I&amp;A 
&gt;Forum Charter.
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Dave Dodge, from the Operations Directorate of NSA, presented an 
&gt;introduction to the WWW technology.  Mr. Dodge presented an overview of:
&gt; -   The Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) which is one of the most 
&gt;flexible tools for navigating the Internet.
&gt; -   Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) which allow a user to identify the 
&gt;location of a resource and the method used to retrieve it.
&gt; -   The HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) which is used to format Web pages 
&gt;and present URLs to users.
&gt; -   The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) which allows programs run on a server 
&gt;to receive data from a user via an HTTP connection.
&gt; -   JAVA which allows a program to be moved from the server to a client and 
&gt;then executed on the client.  JAVA is designed to "protect you from itself". 
&gt; It has checks that are made during execution.  JAVA is not universally 
&gt;implemented yet.  There is no tag in the HTML
&gt; -   The Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
&gt; -   The Secure-HTTP (S-HTTP)
&gt;
&gt;Questions and Answers:
&gt;Q:   Is a firewall able to differentiate an access made by a user from an 
&gt;access originated by a JAVA applet?
&gt;A:   (from Dave Dodge and Frank Hecker): No.  A JAVA applet can open any 
&gt;random port to the server that provided it.
&gt;Q:   Can a JAVA applet make an access through a proxy?
&gt;A:   (from Frank Hecker).  Either the applet needs to know about that proxy 
&gt;ahead of time or it can make use of the existing HTTP browser.
&gt;Q:   Do search engines present any special I&amp;A issues?
&gt;A:   Most search engines are implemented using the GET or POST HTTP commands 
&gt;which feed a program running on the server.  Control of access to that 
&gt;program is the same as access to any Web page.
&gt;Q:   Is there an IETF Working Group (WG) for WWW?
&gt;A:   The W3C is an industry consortia that deals with Web issues (it's 
&gt;responsible for the new HTML standard).  There are many IETF WGs and 
&gt;standards related to Web topics.
&gt;
&gt;     Ms. Susanne Rosewell, from the ISMC Security office presented a 
&gt;briefing on INTELINK security needs.  She pointed out that there is a panel 
&gt;working on security issues that meets monthly. They are supported by several 
&gt;WGs that are addressing:
&gt; -   JAVA
&gt; -   Access Control
&gt; -   Firewalls
&gt; -   Inter Domain security
&gt;
&gt;     Ms. Rosewell discussed some of the security issues and goals related to 
&gt;INTELINK:
&gt; -   Currently, Local Administrators provide security by reviewing server 
&gt;logs to track who has had access to a server (i.e., no access control). 
&gt; INTELINK would like to provide access control at the "front door" and not 
&gt;at individual servers.
&gt; -   They are looking at using X.509 Version 3 certificates to provide the 
&gt;ability to limit access to no foreign (NOFORN) information.  They also want 
&gt;to use X.509 certificates to identify community of interest (COI).
&gt; -   The Inter Domain WG is investigating the use of commercial off-the-shelf 
&gt;(COTS) multi-level security (MLS) servers to allow a Secret user to access 
&gt;Secret and below data from a server that also contains Top Secret data.
&gt; -   A long term goal is to provide "true data labeling" so that data may 
&gt;carry and maintain a sensitivity label.
&gt;
&gt;Questions and Answers:
&gt;Q:   Isn't it harder to get Secret data into a Top Secret enclave than to 
&gt;get Secret data out of  a Top Secret enclave?
&gt;A:   Yes.
&gt;Q:   Is the goal to provide servers that contain both Top Secret and Secret 
&gt;data that is connected to both (S and TS) networks?
&gt;A:   Yes.
&gt;Q:   Is data aggregation an issue?
&gt;A:   Current efforts are to only label individual data objects.
&gt;Q:   How will an individual user determine what technology to use and when 
&gt;to upgrade?
&gt;A:   INTELINK will be mandating a SSL capable browser in the future and is 
&gt;asking people to comply with that requirement now.
&gt;Q:   Will the INTELINK e-mail solution be Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
&gt;(SMTP) or X.400.
&gt;A:   The E-mail application package that INTELINK will standardize on is 
&gt;still an issue.  They need a application now and consider SMTP as the only 
&gt;current option. X.400 applications (from the Defense Message System [DMS]) 
&gt;are somewhere down the road.
&gt;Q:   Commercial MLS servers are not readily available, the market has not 
&gt;been established. How will INTELINK obtain COTS MLS servers?
&gt;A:   There are a few MLS workstations available.  INTELINK is working with 
&gt;NSA and vendors to solve this issue.
&gt;Q:   INTELINK is requiring the use of Version 3 X.509 certificates, DMS has 
&gt;an infrastructure based on Version 1 certificates.  Is anyone working on 
&gt;solving this issue.
&gt;A:   There is an INTELINK representative on the MISSI Key Privilege &amp; 
&gt;Certificate WG (KP&amp;CWG) which is working on the problem of incompatible 
&gt;X.500 infrastructures.  Conversion from Version 1 to Version 3 X.509 
&gt;certificates is a transition issue for DMS.  The issue is the timing of the 
&gt;conversion to Version 3 certificates.  There was never any intention to 
&gt;interoperate between the two versions.
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Michael Louden, who is involved with Mitre corporate management of 
&gt;computer and network operations briefed "A Corporate Experience Using The 
&gt;Web (An INFOSEC Point Of View).  The briefing provided an overview of the 
&gt;Mitre Information Infrastructure (MII).  In the area of security, the 
&gt;briefing included the MII security environment, key security features, 
&gt;security trade-offs, and security issues. Miter has different access control 
&gt;mechanisms (e.g., Passwords, Tickets) for different servers and would like 
&gt;to centralize/standardize the access control mechanisms.
&gt;
&gt;Questions and Answers:
&gt;Q:   When Mitre splits into two separate organizations, will you have to 
&gt;totally rework your access control rights?
&gt;A:   Mitre plans to duplicate the access control system and then delete the 
&gt;individuals from the other organization.
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Dale Hapeman, the Booz(Allen I&amp;A task leader, presented a briefing 
&gt;on "Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) WWW Requirements."  He started the 
&gt;brief by reviewing the Context Diagram from the I&amp;A CONOPS and presented an 
&gt;operational environment which showed Web clients an servers relative to SBU 
&gt;enclaves.  Mr. Hapeman followed with an explanation of how each facet of a 
&gt;MISSI security policy could be applied to data as it is being transferred 
&gt;between a Client and Server through multiple firewalls.  He provided 
&gt;definitions of Authorized and Authenticated.  Mr. Hapeman finished with an 
&gt;invitation to the audience to consider the policies they would like to see 
&gt;implemented at the different components involved in a WWW access (client, 
&gt;server, and firewall).
&gt;
&gt;     Ms. Judith Furlong is a lead INFOSEC Engineer at the Mitre corporation. 
&gt;She presented a briefing titled "IETF/W3C Secure Web Standards Activity." 
&gt; Ms. Furlong started her briefing with a discussion of the following 
&gt;existing Web security standards
&gt; -   SSL Protocol
&gt; -   S-HTTP
&gt; -   Private Communication Technology (PCT) protocol
&gt; -   Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) Protocol
&gt;
&gt;     Ms. Furlong followed with an overview of the W3C, including a 
&gt;discussion of the W3C Security WG. Ms. Furlong covered:
&gt; -   The Protocol Extension Protocol (PEP), a W3C proposal for extending HTTP 
&gt;to accommodate additional capabilities such as security, watermarks, 
&gt;labeling etc. She further described the Security Extension Architecture 
&gt;(SEA) using the proposed PEP.
&gt; -   The Joint Electronic Payment Initiative (JEPI), a joint WG between the 
&gt;W3C's Electronic Payments WG and CommerceNet which is developing an Internet 
&gt;payment protocol negotiation scheme and a standard interface for payment 
&gt;modules.
&gt; -   The Digital Signature Initiative which deals with issues associated with 
&gt;applying digital signatures to objects such as video frames.
&gt; -   The Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) WG which has the 
&gt;charter to design technology to support "values-based" content 
&gt;rating/labeling. The PICS technology has security applicability.
&gt;
&gt;     Ms. Furlong provided an overview of the IETF and its Web Transaction 
&gt;Security (WTS) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) WGs.
&gt;     She completed her briefing with a discussion of the following security 
&gt;areas not being addressed by standards efforts:
&gt; -   Secure Search capabilities
&gt; -   Mobile Code Security
&gt; -   Security Management Functions
&gt; -   Interfaces to Security Infrastructures
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Frank Hecker, a senior systems engineer with Netscape 
&gt;Communications Corporation, presented a briefing on Netscape and Web 
&gt;Security.   The briefing covered the security areas and technologies that 
&gt;Netscape is active in.  Mr. Hecker started with a discussion of SSL and how 
&gt;Netscape has improved it through upgrades to their Navigator software as 
&gt;well as additional SSL issues they are investigating.  He also covered 
&gt;Netscape's security related issues:
&gt; -   Support for hardware tokens other than FORTEZZA.
&gt; -   Making a browser "firewall aware" (e.g., able to authenticate to 
&gt;intermediate firewalls) without becoming susceptible to man-in-the-middle 
&gt;attacks.
&gt; -   Providing directory services for use by many different types of 
&gt;applications.
&gt; -   Downloadable applications (JAVA and JAVASCRIPT)
&gt; -   Financial transactions - Netscape will implement SET
&gt; -   Secure e-mail - S/multipurpose internet mail extensions (MIME) 
&gt;(initially not FORTEZZA)
&gt; -   Public key infrastructure - Committed to X.509 Version 3 Certificates
&gt; -   User and/or administrator configurability - Netscape will have a toolkit 
&gt;to support Navigator 3.0.
&gt;
&gt;Questions and Answers:
&gt;Q:   What are Netscape's plans for supporting applications other than Web 
&gt;browsing over SSL connections?
&gt;A:   Netscape currently implements HTTP, NNTP over SSL.  They plan on 
&gt;implementing lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) over SSL in the 
&gt;future.  file ransfer protocol (FTP), TELNET, and SMTP/POP3/IMAP4 are 
&gt;possible but not planned.  Other vendors or individuals have implemented 
&gt;TELNET and FTP over SSL.
&gt;Q:   How does a user deal with non-SSL servers or optionally implementing 
&gt;SSL on a connection?
&gt;A:   A page that must be accessed with SSL is designated with a URL starting 
&gt;with https:// (instead of http://).
&gt;
&gt;     Dr. Rick Smith an information security consultant with Secure Computing 
&gt;Corporation presented a briefing titled "Protecting Web Sites From Attack". 
&gt; Dr. Smith started his presentation with a history of some of the more well 
&gt;known sever penetrations.  Dr. Smith discussed several types of attacks and 
&gt;methods of protection with Type Enforcement Encapsulation.
&gt;
&gt;Questions and Answers:
&gt;Q:   Where are the tables used for type enforcement defined?
&gt;A:   There is an Administrators Tool that includes this function.
&gt;Q:   How many domains and types can Sidewinder implement?
&gt;A:   Dozens.
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Mike Zauzig, a senior products development engineer with 
&gt;SecureWare,  presented a briefing on "Security Products For WWW 
&gt;Applications."  Mr. Zauzig provided an overview of  his company, aspects to 
&gt;web security, and the following SecureWare products:
&gt; -   Hannah - Network Security
&gt; -   Troy - Platform Integrity Assurance
&gt; -   SecureMail - E-mail Security
&gt; -   Secure Web Platform Integrity - Safe Web Server
&gt; -   Interceptor - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP Firewall
&gt; -   Internet Scanner - Attack Simulator
&gt;
&gt;Questions and Answers:
&gt;Q:   Is SecureWare's mail package interoperable with other FORTEZZA e-mail 
&gt;implementations.
&gt;A:   Yes (Dave Luddy).
&gt;Q:   The Security First Network Bank shows a Web server that is connected to 
&gt;directly the Internet (not through the firewall).  Is this machine running 
&gt;SSL on one side and Hannah on the other?
&gt;A:   Yes.
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Hapeman presented a briefing which attempted to summarize the 
&gt;security requirements presented at the day's meeting.  He reviewed the 
&gt;security services needed and the requirements that are allocated to 
&gt;components.  He also discussed the protocol requirements and possible 
&gt;solutions available to secure the Web.  Different options for authenticating 
&gt;to firewalls placed between clients and servers were presented.  Much work 
&gt;remains to secure the proxy or tunneling solutions.
&gt;
&gt;Questions and Answers:
&gt;Q:   The Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) protocol has not been mentioned 
&gt;all day.  It is very mature and has had much NSA input (especially the 
&gt;Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol [ISAKMP] key 
&gt;management protocol).  It should be considered as a security solution.
&gt;A:   Agreed.  IPSec is a viable option, especially for authenticated 
&gt;firewall-to-firewall connections.  It was not mentioned by name but is 
&gt;certainly being considered as a solution.
&gt;
&gt;     Mr. Luddy's closing comments were:
&gt; -   NIST FIPS PUB JJJ has been discussed at previous I&amp;A Forums.  Although 
&gt;it presents an authentication scheme, it does not provide for interoperable 
&gt;solutions.  Dave Kemp has authored a Public Key Login Protocol that provides 
&gt;the detail needed for interoperability.  The document will be submitted as 
&gt;an IETF Internet draft.  Comments are solicited.
&gt; -   The I&amp;A CONOPS document will be sent out by e-mail to everyone who 
&gt;registered.
&gt; -   The topic for the next I&amp;A Forum is Access Control.  It is scheduled for 
&gt;8-9 July 1996.
