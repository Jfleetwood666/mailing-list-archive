&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        INTRODUCTION
&gt;
&gt;        Sports fans in the United States will be surprised to learn
&gt;that U.S. Government officials are pressing for the adoption of
&gt;an International treaty that will (if enacted) significantly
&gt;change the ways sports statistics are controlled and
&gt;disseminated.  The treaty isn't specifically directed at sports
&gt;statistics -- it is a much broader attempt to create a new
&gt;property right in facts and other data now in the public domain -
&gt;- but it will have an enormous impact on the legal rights
&gt;exercised by the National Football League (NFL), Major League
&gt;Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the
&gt;National Hockey League (NHL) and virtually all other professional
&gt;or amateur athletic leagues.  [The same treaty will radically
&gt;affect the way that stock prices, weather data, train schedules,
&gt;data from AIDS research and other facts are controlled, but this
&gt;note will focus on the issue of sports statistics, a topic that
&gt;illustrates the broad impact of the treaty].
&gt;
&gt;        This comes at the same time the NBA and other sports
&gt;franchises are stepping up their efforts to control the real time
&gt;dissemination of sports statistics through the Internet or with
&gt;wireless paging devices.  [See, for example,
&gt;http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,3208,00.html].  The treaty,
&gt;however, addresses different and much more fundamental issues
&gt;regarding ownership of information.
&gt;
&gt;If the treaty is approved and implemented, sports leagues
&gt;will have far broader powers to dictate the terms and conditions
&gt;under which sport statistics are reported and disseminated.
&gt;Nolan Ryan's Earned Run Average (ERA), the number of tackles or
&gt;quarterback sacks by Lawrence Taylor, Cal Ripken's career batting
&gt;average, Bobby Hull's career assists, the number of steals by
&gt;your favorite NBA point guard, and similar information will be
&gt;"owned" by sports leagues.  According to the proposed treaty (and
&gt;legislation introduced in the 104th Congress to implement the
&gt;treaty), the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB will have the right to prevent
&gt;anyone from publishing these and other statistics without express
&gt;permission from the sports league.  This will include the right
&gt;to control access to the historical archives of sports
&gt;statistics, and even to dictate who can publish the box scores
&gt;from a game or print a pitcher's ERA on the back of a baseball
&gt;card.
&gt;
&gt;        The proposals for a new legal environment for publishing
&gt;facts are outlined in a draft treaty on "databases" that will be
&gt;considered at a December 1996 meeting of the World Intellectual
&gt;Property Organization (WIPO), in Geneva, Switzerland.  [See
&gt;www.public-domain.org/database/database.html]  The proposal would
&gt;require the United States and other countries to create a new
&gt;property right for public domain materials. "Texts, sounds,
&gt;images, numbers, facts, or data representing any other matter or
&gt;substance," will be protected.  [See the appendix for a more
&gt;complete definition].
&gt;
&gt;The treaty seeks, for the first time, to permit firms to
&gt;"own" facts they gather, and to restrict and control the
&gt;redissemination of those facts.  The new property right would lie
&gt;outside (and on top) of the copyright laws, and create an
&gt;entirely new and untested form of regulation that would radically
&gt;change the public's current rights to use and disseminate facts
&gt;and statistics.  American University Law Professor Peter Jaszi
&gt;recently said the treaty represents "the end of the public
&gt;domain."
&gt;
&gt;Copies of the proposed treaty, a federal register notice
&gt;asking for public comment, and independent commentary can be
&gt;found at:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.public-domain.org/database/database.html
&gt;
&gt;WHO IS PUSHING FOR THE DATABASE TREATY?
&gt;
&gt;        In 1991, the US Supreme Court ruled (in the Feist decision)
&gt;that the facts from a telephone "White Pages" directory of names,
&gt;addresses and phone numbers were not protected under the
&gt;copyright laws, and that in general, "facts" could not be
&gt;copyrighted by anyone.  The Feist decision alarmed several large
&gt;database vendors, who crafted this new "sui generis" property
&gt;right that would protect facts, and just about everything else.
&gt;[The vendors have already succeeded in obtaining a directive on
&gt;database proposal from the European Union, although no European
&gt;country has yet passed legislation to implement the treaty]. The
&gt;most active supporter of this new property right is West
&gt;Publishing, the Canadian legal publisher. A West Publishing
&gt;employee chairs a key ABA subcommittee which wrote a favorable
&gt;report on the treaty.  A number of very large British and Dutch
&gt;database vendors are also lobbying hard for the treaty.
&gt;
&gt;West wants the new property right to protect the "page
&gt;numbers" and "corrections" it adds to the judicial opinions it
&gt;publishes in paper bound books.  Telephone companies want to
&gt;protect the names, addresses and telephone numbers they publish,
&gt;and other database vendors what to protect scientific data or
&gt;other non-copyrighted government information they publish.  In
&gt;seeking to protect these items, the treaty was written to stamp
&gt;"owned by" labels on a vast sea of information now in the public
&gt;domain.  Copyright experts J.H. Reichman and Pamela Samuelson
&gt;say  it is the "least balanced and most potentially anti-
&gt;competitive intellectual property rights ever created."
&gt;[http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/iip/reisamda.html]
&gt;
&gt;There is an active debate within the Clinton Administration
&gt;over the proposed treaty.   Bruce Lehman, the controversial head
&gt;of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is pushing for adoption
&gt;of the treaty this December.  Most administration official don't
&gt;have a clue what the database treaty does.  Some people think it
&gt;is a minor tinkering with the current copyright law.  No one in
&gt;the government has sought to understand the significance of the
&gt;proposal in terms of the new rights to "own" facts, and until
&gt;recently no one was aware that the treaty was so broad that it
&gt;would change the way sports or financial statistics were
&gt;controlled.
&gt;
&gt;        HOW WILL THE TREATY WORK?
&gt;
&gt;        In Feist, the Supreme Court noted:
&gt;
&gt;     (a) Article I, Sec. 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution mandates
&gt;     originality as a prerequisite or copyright protection. The
&gt;     constitutional requirement necessitates independent creation
&gt;     plus a modicum of creativity. Since facts do not owe their
&gt;     origin to an act of authorship, they are not original and,
&gt;     thus, are not copyrightable.
&gt;     [From the Syllabus of the opinion, at
&gt;     http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/classics/499_340v.htm]
&gt;
&gt;Since facts cannot be copyrighted, the supporters of the
&gt;treaty have framed this as a new "sui generis" property right,
&gt;which will have a separate statutory framework.  "Originality" or
&gt;"authorship" will not be required. "Texts, sounds, images,
&gt;numbers, facts, or data representing any other matter or
&gt;substance," will be protected. The information can be stored in
&gt;"all forms or media now known or later developed." Both published
&gt;and confidential information will be covered.  The only thing
&gt;required is a  "substantial investment in the collection,
&gt;assembly, verification, organization or presentation of the
&gt;contents" of the protected work.  The "rightholder" will have
&gt;extremely broad powers to "authorize or prohibit the extraction
&gt;or utilization" of the information from the protected database.
&gt;
&gt;It takes a while for the implications of this new system to
&gt;sink in.  Some facts can be independently gathered, like the
&gt;number of baseball games played in a year, the winners or losers
&gt;of a tennis match, or the scores of a football game.  For these
&gt;data, there may exist several sources for the data.  However,
&gt;other facts are, by their very nature, only available from a
&gt;single source, and will be controlled by monopolies.  For
&gt;example, baseball leagues employ scorekeepers who determine if a
&gt;batter is credited with a hit or if a fielder committed an error,
&gt;if a hit is reported as a single or double, or if an errant pitch
&gt;is scored as a wild pitch or a passed ball.  The league makes a
&gt;"substantial investment" in the collection and maintenance of
&gt;this data, which it disseminates to the press, and also stores
&gt;and maintains in a database, through an arrangement with the
&gt;Elias Sports Bureau.  These data cannot be independently
&gt;collected - and under the proposed database treaty, the league
&gt;would own the facts themselves, and could dictate the terms under
&gt;which these facts are published or redisseminated.
&gt;
&gt;The NFL employs four persons who keep track of the play-by-
&gt;play action for each game.  They write up four separate reports,
&gt;which are used to create a single official "box score." The final
&gt;product is supervised by the Elias Sports Bureau, as a "work for
&gt;hire" product, which is owned by the NFL. The NFL box score is
&gt;very detailed, and includes analysis of each play.   It records
&gt;the league's statistics for the number of yards gained (or lost)
&gt;on each play, who is credited with a tackle or a quarterback
&gt;sack, or the number return yards on a kickoff or pass
&gt;interception, and many other items.  While someone who attended a
&gt;football game could make an independent estimate of these items,
&gt;it would likely be different from the official statistics, due to
&gt;the inherent difficulty in measuring or assigning credit for
&gt;performance on the field.  The NFL's box score is given to the
&gt;press, which uses the data to create its own news media reports.
&gt;
&gt;An attorney who represents the National Football League
&gt;(NFL) told us that the NFL has an interest in insuring that there
&gt;is an "official" source of the statistics, which are gathered
&gt;with an appropriate standard of care and that the NFL "protects
&gt;the official designation" of its statistics.  These data are used
&gt;for making decisions on the Hall of Fame, and to create special
&gt;reports and information products, which the NFL provides to third
&gt;parties, often for a fee.
&gt;
&gt;Virtually all of the major league sports leagues have some
&gt;system for creating statistics, disseminating the information to
&gt;the press, storing the historical data, and marketing the
&gt;statistics commercially.   Major League Baseball and the NBA work
&gt;with Elias, while the NBA and the NHL have their own in-house
&gt;system.  There is little doubt the process by which these
&gt;statistics are generated will qualify for protection, under the
&gt;treaty's minimal requirement that the league demonstrate it has
&gt;made a "substantial investment in the collection, assembly,
&gt;verification, organization or presentation of the contents" of
&gt;database.  The work-for-hire "media sheets," "box scores," and
&gt;other press handouts which report the statistics would be
&gt;considered database elements, and reporting of statistics from
&gt;these products would be subject to an entirely new type of
&gt;licensing and control by the leagues which is far stronger than
&gt;that which exists under copyright law.  [See appendix].
&gt;
&gt;The leagues have various methods of selling their "official"
&gt;branded statistics.  There are also many competitors who build
&gt;databases from a variety of sources, including the published box
&gt;scores that appear in daily newspapers, and probably the books
&gt;and reports published by the leagues.  The leagues do not
&gt;currently assert "ownership" in the statistics directly, even as
&gt;they try to prevent others from referring to the data as
&gt;"official" statistics, but they are trying to prevent real time
&gt;reporting of game statistics and situations over Internet or
&gt;paging technologies.
&gt;
&gt;The NBA told us that it permits accredited journalists to
&gt;report scores from NBA games three times each quarter, and that
&gt;it considers the minute to minute reports a "misappropriation" of
&gt;its ability to sell performance rights for the event.  The NFL
&gt;takes a similar position with respect to its games.  STATS, Inc.
&gt;is a firm that provides real time scores and play-by-play
&gt;descriptors to a variety of online and wireless information
&gt;services.  According to the NFL and the NBA, STATS, Inc. hires
&gt;people to watch television broadcasts of the games, and type the
&gt;play-by-play information into personal computers, which are
&gt;linked to the STATS, Inc. computer network services.  An example
&gt;of this type of service that uses STATS, Inc. as a supplier of
&gt;statistics is Instant Baseball, available at
&gt;http://www.InstantSports.com/.  Disputes over the real time
&gt;Internet broadcasts of game situations and scores could well end
&gt;up before the U.S. Supreme Court, as a test of the first
&gt;amendment.  In the NBA case involving Motorola, STATS, Inc. and
&gt;America Online, the NFL and other leagues have filed amicus
&gt;briefs in support of the NBA position, while the New York Times
&gt;has filed a brief in support of Motorola, STATS, Inc. and America
&gt;Online.
&gt;
&gt;About two weeks ago the NBA discovered HR 3531, a version of
&gt;the database protection proposal that was introduced in the U.S.
&gt;Congress last spring.  The NBA is looking at HR 3531 to see if it
&gt;would provide a legislative remedy for their dispute with
&gt;Motorola, et. al.  (Like the other leagues, the NBA wasn't aware
&gt;of the database treaty until last week.)
&gt;
&gt;At present, none of the leagues currently prevent anyone
&gt;from publishing statistics after a game is over, because it is
&gt;assumed that the statistics (facts) are in the public domain,
&gt;once the broadcasts are over.  But this would likely change if
&gt;the database treaty is enacted.  One league official told me, "no
&gt;matter how appalled I am at this proposal personally, as a civil
&gt;libertarian, my client may have interests as a rightholder that
&gt;it will want to exercise."  A lawyer for the NFL said that the
&gt;NFL might not want to do anything - he thought the free
&gt;dissemination of statistics brought its own benefits, in terms of
&gt;increased fan interest.  But he also said, the treaty would allow
&gt;the NFL to "do quite a bit of stuff," in terms of new licensing
&gt;arrangements or other ventures, if it wanted to.
&gt;
&gt;As a "sui generis" property right, the database proposal
&gt;does not incorporate the fair use principles from copyright that
&gt;reporters and value added publishers often take for granted.  The
&gt;leagues would be able to require license to publish box scores or
&gt;other statistics in any media.  One can imagine a world where the
&gt;leagues wouldn't require licensing of box scores to print based
&gt;periodicals like daily newspapers, but that a much more
&gt;controlled regimen would evolve on the Internet.  The leagues
&gt;could require licensing of box scores and other statistics for
&gt;Internet publications, or linking to the leagues own web sites,
&gt;such as www.nba.com, www.nba.com, or www.nhl.com.  The Internet
&gt;is, after all, a very easy place to locate and police violations
&gt;of intellectual property rights --  through a simple AltaVista
&gt;search.  This would also likely lead to major changes in the
&gt;market for baseball (and other sports) cards, which typically
&gt;feature key statistics on the flip side of the card.  The new
&gt;database extract rights would prohibit any unauthorized
&gt;extraction or reuse of data that had economic value to the
&gt;leagues (See discussion in Appendix).
&gt;
&gt;WHAT CAN YOU DO?
&gt;
&gt;The government is taking comments on the database treaty
&gt;through November 22, 1996.  If you don't think the government
&gt;should rush into a new regulatory scheme for sports statistics,
&gt;let them know.  You can email your comments to:
&gt;diploconf@uspto.gov.
&gt;
&gt;If you want to know more about his proposal, check out
&gt;http://www.public-domain.org/database/database.html.
&gt;
&gt;PS
&gt;
&gt;Of course, this treaty deals with a lot more than sports
&gt;statistics.  It will do the same thing for information on stock
&gt;prices that is generated by a stock exchange.  It will radically
&gt;change the market for weather information.   There is concern in
&gt;Europe over the control over train schedules.  Private Schools
&gt;could use the new data extraction right to prevent unauthorized
&gt;publication of data about its student's test scores or post
&gt;graduate placement statistics (both generated from a database).
&gt;The treaty would radically change the rights to use information
&gt;from gene sequencing, or hospital cost benefit studies.  It will
&gt;obviously do much much more.
&gt;
&gt;Since I have tried to keep this note simple, a lot has been
&gt;left out.  But consider this.  The treaty, which was designed to
&gt;protect West Publishing's legal reporters, has been written so
&gt;broadly that it will define even the daily newspaper as a
&gt;"database" element.  Since the new property right is additive to
&gt;to all rights claimed under copyright, every publisher will claim
&gt;the additional protection, by saying each issue of the newpaper
&gt;is a database element.  (virtually all newspapers today are
&gt;archived in databases). The consequences of this are astounding,
&gt;since every fact and article in every newspaper will have the new
&gt;stronger form of protection, which will not include any public
&gt;fair use rights.

&gt;You might ask your member of Congress what the heck is going
&gt;on with the treaty, and see if they understand it.

&gt;Extracts from James Love, "A Primer On The Proposed WIPO Treaty
&gt;On Database Extraction Rights That Will Be Considered In December
&gt;1996, October 29, 1996, http://www.essential.org/cpt/ip/cpt-
&gt;dbcom.html]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;WHAT IS A DATABASE? WHAT ISN'T A DATABASE?
&gt;
&gt;The treaty would protect "any database that represents a
&gt;substantial investment in the collection, assembly, verification,
&gt;organization or presentation of the contents of the database."
&gt;This term should be understood "to include collections of
&gt;literary, musical or audiovisual works or any other kind of
&gt;works, or collections of other materials such as texts, sounds,
&gt;images, numbers, facts, or data representing any other matter or
&gt;substance" and "may contain collections of expressions of
&gt;folklore." The "protection shall be granted to databases
&gt;irrespective of the form or medium in which they are embodied.
&gt;Protection extends to databases in both electronic and non-
&gt;electronic form" and "embraces all forms or media now known or
&gt;later developed. . . Protection shall be granted to databases
&gt;regardless of whether they are made available to the public. This
&gt;means that databases that are made generally available to the
&gt;public, commercially or otherwise, as well as databases that
&gt;remain within the exclusive possession and control of their
&gt;developers enjoy protection on the same footing."
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;WHAT ARE EXTRACTION AND UTILIZATION RIGHTS?
&gt;
&gt;"The maker of a database eligible for protection under this
&gt;Treaty shall have the right to authorize or prohibit the
&gt;extraction or utilization of its contents." What is "extraction"?
&gt;Extraction is defined as, "the permanent or temporary transfer of
&gt;all or a substantial part of the contents of a database to
&gt;another medium by any means or in any form." "Extraction . . . is
&gt;a synonym for `copying' or `reproduction' . . . by `any means' or
&gt;`any form' that is now known or later developed."
&gt;
&gt;"Utilization" is defined as "making available to the public all
&gt;or a substantial part of the contents of a database by any means,
&gt;including by the distribution of copies, by renting, or by on-
&gt;line or other forms of transmission," including the right to
&gt;control the use of the data "at a time individually chosen by
&gt;each member of the public."
&gt;
&gt;WHAT IS A "SUBSTANTIAL PART" OF THE DATABASE?
&gt;
&gt;The treaty sets out tests for determining if an extraction is
&gt;"substantial," and these tests are both highly anticompetitive,
&gt;and extremely broad in scope.
&gt;
&gt;The "substantiality" of a portion of the database is assessed
&gt;against the "value of the database," and considers "qualitative
&gt;and quantitative aspects," noting that "neither aspect is more
&gt;important than the other . . . This assessment may also take into
&gt;account the diminution in market value that may result from the
&gt;use of the portion, including the added risk that the investment
&gt;in the database will not be recoverable. It may even include an
&gt;assessment of whether a new product using the portion could serve
&gt;as a commercial substitute for the original, diminishing the
&gt;market for the original."
&gt;
&gt;Then the treaty adds that a "substantial part" means any portion
&gt;of the database, "including an accumulation of small portions . .
&gt;. In practice, repeated or systematic use of small portions of
&gt;the contents of a database may have the same effect as extraction
&gt;or utilization of a large, or substantial, part of the contents
&gt;of the database."
&gt;
&gt;In the US implementing legislation, the only types of data use
&gt;that would not be regulated would be "insubstantial" parts,
&gt;"whose extraction, use or reuse does not diminish the value of
&gt;the database, conflict with a normal exploitation of the database
&gt;or adversely affect the actual or potential market for the
&gt;database." Under this language, a database owner could say that
&gt;it might in the future want to charge for each transmission of a
&gt;fact or an element of a database as part of its "normal
&gt;exploitation" of the database. With the Internet and digital cash
&gt;this claim is likely to be made. The public would not have "fair
&gt;use" rights, since fair use is only defined in matters involving
&gt;copyright.
&gt;
&gt;FOR HOW LONG? 15 YEARS, 25 YEARS, OR FOREVER?
&gt;
&gt;The Treaty would require a minimum term of protection (15 years
&gt;in the EU proposal, and 25 in the United States proposal) for the
&gt;database. But this is extended each time the database is revised
&gt;or enhanced. According to the draft treaty, "any substantial
&gt;change to the database, evaluated qualitatively or
&gt;quantitatively, including any substantial change resulting from
&gt;the accumulation of successive additions, deletions,
&gt;verifications, modifications in organization or presentation, or
&gt;other alterations, which constitute a new substantial investment,
&gt;shall qualify the database resulting from such investment for its
&gt;own term of protection."
&gt;
&gt;The provision on revisions raises the specter that protection for
&gt;many databases will be perpetual. This could indeed be the case
&gt;if the original versions of the database  are only "licensed" by
&gt;the vendor for a limited period of time, so that the only
&gt;available versions would be the new ones, which would have a new
&gt;term of protection. [Database vendors write these restricted use
&gt;licenses now].
