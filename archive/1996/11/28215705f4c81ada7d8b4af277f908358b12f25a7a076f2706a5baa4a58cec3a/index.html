create a brief Net profile of our friend Dr. Vulis.  Here's what

Q: Who is Dimitri Vulis? 
A: Dimitri is an XSoviet immigrant who is enrolled (or used to be 
enrolled) in CUNY, and who is a computer professional involved 
i.a. in unicode matters. The realspace Dimitri is a polite person 
and a devoted family head.  It's cyberspace image is not nearly 
as nice, unfortunately. 

He harasses people all over the net with the most offensive sorts 
of messages, and uses dirty tricks to retaliate to the people who 
do get offended. Among his accomplished feats is a series of 
articles about cat-eating dogs posted to rec.pets.cats (which 
caused a wave of complaints and made him lost his CUNY account) ; 
a series of porno binaries with obscene comments about his 
opponents posted to math-related newsgroups (he lost another 
academic account, at fordham.edu, after this scandal); and a 
series of racist articles denigrating all aspects of romanian 
life and culture which used to haunt the romanian newsgroup for 
years. 

Of course most of his net.bile is spilled over his fellow 
XSoviets, particularly of Jewish origin (such as Michael 
Verbitsky, Boris Veytsman, Vlad Rutenberg or myself, as well as 
all Brighton Beach together); and a lot of stuff comes out from 
his alleged aliases in bwalk.dm.com, aol.com and fly.harvard.edu. 
Some of these aliases match the names of his opponents, as I 
already mentioned.  Sometimes not only the names but also 
addresses match (although paths don't). 

Dimitri Vulis also advertises the capabilities of his site for 
forging and cancelling articles. Sometimes he shrewdly comments 
articles of his own saying : "This article is most certainly 
forged, after all I spent a lot of time teaching you how to 
forge... but I nevertheless like this article's content".

Dimitri Vulis:
Contrib. post:
 whose obnoxious, derivative and not-very-funny Soviet emigre 
jokes from Brighton Beach were a weekly feature about a year ago 
on rec.humor . He ignored completely any requests to stop. 
Eventually he started getting flamed in demotic Russian-quite fun 
for those of us who could read it.
- Dan "And to think he felt it important enough to waste his two 
hours of daily connect time on it" Case

 so what _is_ the deal with vulis?  is "russian emigre" a 
codeword for "jew", or for "russian emigre", or for something 
else?  (if i recall correctly, minor and now somewhat reformed 
net.loon mikhail zeleny claimed rather convincingly that vulis's 
posts contained certain tell-tale phrases which are highly 
un-idiomatic in english ("dandruff-covered" was one of them, i 
think) which were dead giveaways of classic pathological russian 
anti-semitism.)  so is vulis russian?  an emigre?  a jew in some 
sense?  self-hating?  maybe a self-hating russian jewish emigre 
who hates only the jewish half of themself?  or maybe they hate 
the russian half too?  are they now or have they ever been, while 
residing in america, on the payroll of any branch of any soviet 
or russian government?  did they stop posting russian emigre 
jokes when the paychecks stopped coming?  are they a zhirinovsky 
supporter now?  the most recent messages posted by vulis
that i have seen seem designed mainly to convince people that 
both zhirinovsky and valery fabrikant are (russian?) jews.  (it's 
very likely true in fabrikant's case, at least.)  maybe vulis is 
a self-hating supporter of zhirinovsky and fabrikant?

Posts on soc.culture.soviet, and is apparently something of an 
institution there; likes to stir things up, and to flame and/or 
troll people. I'm not up on which sides are good and/or bad on 
s.c.s, which among other things seems to have been ravaged by 
Serdar Argic for a long time as well, driving away many
of the gentler posters. Is currently engaged in flamewar with 
Peter V. Vorobieff there. Posts from dlv@CUNYVMS1.GC.CUNY.EDU

This file contains contact information (correct name / address / 
phone / fax #... possibly e-mail address) for sites of interest 
in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). We occasionally 
get asked questions like 'What is the Russian name of IAS?' or 
'What is the postal address of St. Petersburg State U's math 
faculty?' or 'What does IPPI stand for?'. Over the years I've 
collected a fairly complete electronic address book of addresses 
of Soviet sites where mathematical research is done, which I 
gladly share. Sergej Gelfand and Don Parsons have kindly 
contributed their address lists (respectively, more math and 
oncology). An even more complete version of such file, listing 
sites of possible interest to people in other fields, and freely 
available on the Internet, would be very useful to many. Please 
send additions, corrections, suggestions, etc to: CISMAP@DM.COM I 
can't acknowledge everything, but I will try to read every 
e-mail. Dimitri Vulis )
