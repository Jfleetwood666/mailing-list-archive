This Message Contains Important Information About Violations
of Your On-Line Privacy.



*Email and Online Security Violations.*
Please be advised that information contained in email is similar 
to a post card.  It can easily be read in transit and does not go 
directly from your computer, to the computer of the recipient.  
Your message often passes through the hands of countless 
computer systems on its path to where you sent it.  Because of 
this, it can easily be seen by many prying eyes on the way to its 
destination.  If you are mailing personal, business or financial 
data it is unwise to use traditional email.  There are many people 
on the net who profit by snooping in the open "post card" style 
email that most account holders utilize.  Programs are readily 
available to make this task simple.  Additionally, many people 
are purchasing mailing lists which contain your email address.  
If you do not wish to receive unsolicited email, there are a 
number of free and highly effective steps you can take to 
recapture your privacy.

The personal exposure spoken of is not limited to email.  If you 
make use of other internet services such as the World Wide 
Web, your privacy is at even greater risk.  Unless secure, any 
information you enter on a form can be read in transit, just like 
email.  Additionally, most of the information providers you contact 
on the web routinely collect information about you in high detail.  
This information goes right down to where you are located, and 
what kind of computer and operating system you use!

To combat this problem, many countermeasures have been 
developed of which most account holders remain unaware.  The 
on line criminals would like to keep it that way.  Every net citizen 
needs to learn to stop sending "Post Cards" and stop allowing 
distant machines to accumulate large amounts of information 
about who they are and their interests.

There are many simple things you should be doing right now to 
protect your privacy.  Most of the best countermeasures available 
are FREE.  This is because there is still a very strong vein of 
computer experts on the net who believe in an individual's right to 
privacy.  There are excellent, completely free  programs that you 
should be using right now to browse the web in an untraceable 
and private manner, and send email that only the recipient can 
read!

You don't need to be a computer expert to use these tools.  They 
often take little or no additional time and are designed to be very 
simple for the computer illiterate to use.  The computer gurus 
that designed these programs know that it is extremely important 
that average net citizens make use of them.  They have designed 
and continually revised them with that in mind.

My name is Jeff Martin, my associates and I have spent a great 
deal of time researching this subject. It is my goal to provide you 
with access to the best resources available to keep your 
communications private.  My information relates to both email 
and other aspects of the internet such as the World Wide Web.  
This information was put together because I don't feel that others 
are making it available in this form of wide distribution, and it 
needs to be done.  The internet is just like a city in that you need 
some street smarts to keep yourself as safe as possible.  That's 
the kind of information I wish would have been provided to me 
when I began to go on line, and it is what I have tried hard to put 
together to help you out.

In my program you'll learn:

*How to send email that cannot be traced.

*How to send email to your friends and associates that cannot 
be read in transit.

*How to post anonymously to Newsgroups.

*How to browse the web and download files anonymously.

*Why you should (almost) never send financial information over 
the net.

*How to prevent your name from being gathered and sold for 
bulk email use.

*And Much, Much, Much, More ....

My package is a treasure trove of valuable information collected 
to guarantee your privacy!

This is the first time I am making this information available.  In a 
short while, the program will be retailing for $59.95.  However, if 
you respond within the next 7 days of receiving this message you 
will receive the special price of $19.95.  Because of the amazing 
expansion of the internet, I have decided to make this offer so 
that everyone can afford to learn how to protect themselves from 
the net's growing criminal element.  After seven days you may 
still order the program at its retail price of $59.95.

Additionally, if you order within the next 48 hours, I'll include a 
very special report about how you can get a free email address 
and account to use from just about anywhere in the U.S.  I'll 
show you how, but you must order within the next 48 hours!

HOW TO ORDER
I strive very hard to protect your security.  I do not accept 
unsecure credit card or check information by email, because it is 
too easily intercepted.  While this could increase my orders, I feel 
that your security as a customer is more important. I am a small
business person and keeping up with phoned and faxed in orders
has proven to be too difficult for me.  Therefore I now only accept
orders via postal (snail) mail.  Please be certain to give me your
email address when ordering.  I prefer to ship orders via email
so that you can have my information as soon as possible.

To order send a check, money order, or credit card information
(Visa, MasterCard, Discover) to me at:

Jeff Martin
POB 72106
Newport, Kentucky 41072

Any credit card orders must use the attached form below.
Thank you very much for your time.

Best Wishes,

Jeff Martin
