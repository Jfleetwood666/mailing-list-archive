Now why don't the cypherpunks put together something like the item below?
In fact, why don't we form some sort of Guild, trademark the term
cypherpunks (I'll volunteer) and offer cracking and security products (like
the one below) or services?  A product security endorsement from
Cypherpunks Inc. could carry a lot of weight :-)

&gt;Subject: Your Email Privacy Has Been Compromised
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This Message Contains Important Information About Violations
&gt;of Your On-Line Privacy.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;*Email and Online Security Violations.*
&gt;Please be advised that information contained in email is similar
&gt;to a post card.  It can easily be read in transit and does not go
&gt;directly from your computer, to the computer of the recipient.
&gt;Your message often passes through the hands of countless
&gt;computer systems on its path to where you sent it.  Because of
&gt;this, it can easily be seen by many prying eyes on the way to its
&gt;destination.  If you are mailing personal, business or financial
&gt;data it is unwise to use traditional email.  There are many people
&gt;on the net who profit by snooping in the open "post card" style
&gt;email that most account holders utilize.  Programs are readily
&gt;available to make this task simple.  Additionally, many people
&gt;are purchasing mailing lists which contain your email address.
&gt;If you do not wish to receive unsolicited email, there are a
&gt;number of free and highly effective steps you can take to
&gt;recapture your privacy.
&gt;
&gt;The personal exposure spoken of is not limited to email.  If you
&gt;make use of other internet services such as the World Wide
&gt;Web, your privacy is at even greater risk.  Unless secure, any
&gt;information you enter on a form can be read in transit, just like
&gt;email.  Additionally, most of the information providers you contact
&gt;on the web routinely collect information about you in high detail.
&gt;This information goes right down to where you are located, and
&gt;what kind of computer and operating system you use!
&gt;
&gt;To combat this problem, many countermeasures have been
&gt;developed of which most account holders remain unaware.  The
&gt;on line criminals would like to keep it that way.  Every net citizen
&gt;needs to learn to stop sending "Post Cards" and stop allowing
&gt;distant machines to accumulate large amounts of information
&gt;about who they are and their interests.
&gt;
&gt;There are many simple things you should be doing right now to
&gt;protect your privacy.  Most of the best countermeasures available
&gt;are FREE.  This is because there is still a very strong vein of
&gt;computer experts on the net who believe in an individual's right to
&gt;privacy.  There are excellent, completely free  programs that you
&gt;should be using right now to browse the web in an untraceable
&gt;and private manner, and send email that only the recipient can
&gt;read!
&gt;
&gt;You don't need to be a computer expert to use these tools.  They
&gt;often take little or no additional time and are designed to be very
&gt;simple for the computer illiterate to use.  The computer gurus
&gt;that designed these programs know that it is extremely important
&gt;that average net citizens make use of them.  They have designed
&gt;and continually revised them with that in mind.
&gt;
&gt;My name is Jeff Martin, my associates and I have spent a great
&gt;deal of time researching this subject. It is my goal to provide you
&gt;with access to the best resources available to keep your
&gt;communications private.  My information relates to both email
&gt;and other aspects of the internet such as the World Wide Web.
&gt;This information was put together because I don't feel that others
&gt;are making it available in this form of wide distribution, and it
&gt;needs to be done.  The internet is just like a city in that you need
&gt;some street smarts to keep yourself as safe as possible.  That's
&gt;the kind of information I wish would have been provided to me
&gt;when I began to go on line, and it is what I have tried hard to put
&gt;together to help you out.
&gt;
&gt;In my program you'll learn:
&gt;
&gt;*How to send email that cannot be traced.
&gt;
&gt;*How to send email to your friends and associates that cannot
&gt;be read in transit.
&gt;
&gt;*How to post anonymously to Newsgroups.
&gt;
&gt;*How to browse the web and download files anonymously.
&gt;
&gt;*Why you should (almost) never send financial information over
&gt;the net.
&gt;
&gt;*How to prevent your name from being gathered and sold for
&gt;bulk email use.
&gt;
&gt;*And Much, Much, Much, More ....
&gt;
&gt;My package is a treasure trove of valuable information collected
&gt;to guarantee your privacy!
&gt;
&gt;This is the first time I am making this information available.  In a
&gt;short while, the program will be retailing for $59.95.  However, if
&gt;you respond within the next 7 days of receiving this message you
&gt;will receive the special price of $19.95.  Because of the amazing
&gt;expansion of the internet, I have decided to make this offer so
&gt;that everyone can afford to learn how to protect themselves from
&gt;the net's growing criminal element.  After seven days you may
&gt;still order the program at its retail price of $59.95.
&gt;
&gt;Additionally, if you order within the next 48 hours, I'll include a
&gt;very special report about how you can get a free email address
&gt;and account to use from just about anywhere in the U.S.  I'll
&gt;show you how, but you must order within the next 48 hours!
&gt;
&gt;HOW TO ORDER
&gt;I strive very hard to protect your security.  I do not accept
&gt;unsecure credit card or check information by email, because it is
&gt;too easily intercepted.  While this could increase my orders, I feel
&gt;that your security as a customer is more important. I am a small
&gt;business person and keeping up with phoned and faxed in orders
&gt;has proven to be too difficult for me.  Therefore I now only accept
&gt;orders via postal (snail) mail.  Please be certain to give me your
&gt;email address when ordering.  I prefer to ship orders via email
&gt;so that you can have my information as soon as possible.
&gt;
&gt;To order send a check, money order, or credit card information
&gt;(Visa, MasterCard, Discover) to me at:
&gt;
&gt;Jeff Martin
&gt;POB 72106
&gt;Newport, Kentucky 41072
&gt;
&gt;Any credit card orders must use the attached form below.
&gt;Thank you very much for your time.
&gt;
&gt;Best Wishes,
&gt;
&gt;Jeff Martin
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This information will always be held in the strictest confidence.
