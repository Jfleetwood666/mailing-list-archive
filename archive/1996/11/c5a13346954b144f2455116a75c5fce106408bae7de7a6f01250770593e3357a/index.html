PUSH COMES TO SHOVE AS NETSCAPE LEADS TECH PARADE
As more and more people are pulled onto the Internet, more and more of the
Internet is being pushed back to people. This week at Comdex, a type of Web
publishing generically referred to as "push" technology received its most
significant endorsement to date with the introduction of Constellation, the
code name for a new technology from Netscape Communications. (November 21,
1996, 12:15 p.m. PT)

COMPUSERVE GETS BACK TO BASICS
CompuServe's announcement today that it is closing down its flagging Wow
service by January 31 marks the end of the company's failed attempts to get
a foot in the door of the potentially lucrative consumer online service
business. "They're throwing in the towel in the consumer market," said Mark
Mooradian of Jupiter Communications. Instead, CompuServe, the second-largest
online service with 5 million users worldwide, plans to refocus itself on
its original mission: serving business customers. (November 21, 1996, 1:15
p.m. PT)

POWERPC NOT OVERSHADOWED AT COMDEX
While Microsoft Windows CE devices may have grabbed most of the attention at
Comdex, important developments in the Mac clone market surfaced, including
new PowerPC reference design platforms from Motorola and IBM and the debut
of a 533-MHz PowerPC prototype system using an Exponential processor.
Motorola this week revealed its Yellowknife PowerPC Platform Reference
Design motherboard that supports the PCI bus and 603e, 604, and 604e PowerPC
microprocessors at clock speeds of up to 240 MHz. (November 21, 1996, 12
p.m. PT)

   http://www.news.com/News/Item/0%2C4%2C5642%2C00.html?nd


TREASURY AGAINST NET TAXES
In a report released today, the U.S. Treasury Department opposed new taxes
on electronic transactions via the Internet, saying income should be taxed
the same whether it comes through existing channels or electronic means. The
report, which makes no formal policy recommendations, also expresses concern
that the Internet may become a tax haven for those who use anonymous
electronic money that cannot be traced and therefore cannot be taxed.
(November 21, 1996, 11:30 a.m. PT)

   http://www.news.com/News/Item/0%2C4%2C5628%2C00.html?nd


COMPAQ LOOKS BEYOND THE DESKTOP
Compaq has expanded its core desktop product lineup to include new efforts
such as NetPCs, network computers (NCs), portable PCs, and handheld devices.
Mike Winkler, the head of Compaq's PC products group, bared the company's
plans for NCs and laid out the future strategy for Windows CE devices in an
interview with CNET at Comdex. (November 21, 1996, 11:15 a.m. PT)

WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO TODAY? HOME
Bill Gates must like Comdex. While other CEOs will fly in to deliver a
speech and fly back out the same day, the Microsoft captain has been in Las
Vegas for at least two days, maybe more. "I've seen him in the hotel bar; he
comes in and has a beer all by himself, and everyone's looking at him," said
one attendee. But like sightings of the Other King, rumors of Gates's
unattended wanderings are probably just that. (November 21, 12:09 a.m. PT)

HOT PRODUCTS SEEN AT COMDEX
Here are some of the hottest new products we found as we wandered the floor
of Fall Comdex. (November 21, 3:00 p.m. PT)
