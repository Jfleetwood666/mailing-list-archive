a good idea.  what we really need to do is to obtain, by whatever means
seems available, a copy of "the briefing", and to publish it, 
on the web/net, with detail anotations of each point. having
their story in public view would certainly take away a lot of it's power.
also, on the off chance that there were any errors in their version of 
the facts, it could make for an interesting q&amp;a session when the next
receiptent didn't buy the pitch.

ps.. no, i don't know, right off-hand, how to obtain such a copy, 
but if the employee manual that was making the rounds a few years was
what it porported to be, well, there's hope for this document to
see the light of day. (-:

&gt; &gt; Patel is then likely to be given the *in camera* presentation
&gt; &gt; of The Deepest Darkest Secrets of Cryptography -- probably a modified
&gt; &gt; version of the classifed briefing the NSA has used with great success to
&gt; &gt; influence members of Congress. Legend has it that no one who ever got 'the
&gt; &gt; briefing' ever again opposed the agency." 
&gt; 
&gt; The last part reminds me of the Monty Python bit about the funniest joke
&gt; in the world -- during the war Brittish soldiers would shout out a
&gt; translated version they couldn't understand and the Germans would die
&gt; laughing.  It seems pretty obvious that there are people who have
&gt; withstood the NSA's siren song -- people in Congress and agencies like the
&gt; Department of Commerce (who presumably have heard it) oppose the agency. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've felt for a long time that the division in venues has hurt us.  The
&gt; other side pitches in secret to Congressmen and administration officials,
&gt; while we preach to the converted and argue against straw men here on the
&gt; net.  As a consequence they own official Washington and we own public
&gt; opinion. 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with this is that we don't get a chance to refute their 
&gt; arguments.  I think we're right -- and to me believing we're right means 
&gt; beliving that we can win a fair fight.  Logic and the facts ought to bear 
&gt; us out.
&gt; 
&gt; One idea that I toyed around with but was too lazy to pursue was to have a
&gt; public debate on the web.  A small group of people would be invited to
&gt; participate -- maybe Dr. Denning on one side, and whoever else we could
&gt; find to speak for the government.  We could pick an equal number of our
&gt; best people to go up against them. 
&gt; 
&gt; The debate would proceed in rounds.  Each particpant could write his or
&gt; her arguments for or against government restrictions on crypto, and the
&gt; moderator would publish them all simultaneously.  Then there would a set 
&gt; period of time for the participants to write responses -- maybe a couple 
&gt; of days or a week.  Then another round of responses to the responses.  
&gt; After that everyone could write closing arguments.
&gt; 
&gt; I think there are a couple of advantages to taking this sort of an
&gt; approach rather than a more free form discussion on a mail list.  The
&gt; first is that the other side would probably feel more welcome -- the lack
&gt; of public support for their position and the net being what it is have
&gt; combined to create a hostile environment for those who disagree with us. 
&gt; The debate would prevent personal attacks (if we pick the right
&gt; participants) and it would give the opposition some assurances that they
&gt; won't get shouted down.  The idea is to create a level playing field --
&gt; something that doesn't exist anywhere right now -- each side has it's own
&gt; home court, but a neutral space doesn't seem to exist.
&gt; 
&gt; Another advantage would be that if people agree to particpate they'd
&gt; probably take it seriously enough to follow through and answer criticisms
&gt; of their arguments.  The idea of a formal discussion with a beginning, a
&gt; middle, and an end might help keep things moving along.  Restricting
&gt; things to a small number of participants who understand the technology and
&gt; the history of crypto politics could also be helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, when the whole thing was over the web site would be a valuable 
&gt; resource for anyone who wants to explore the issue.  Both sides would be 
&gt; there nobody would feel that they had been bullied or manipulated into 
&gt; believing one thing or another.
&gt; 
&gt; As I said above, I think we're right, and to me that means believing that
&gt; we'd come out on top in a fair fight.  It seems to me that we ought to
&gt; figure out how to set up a few of them and do whatever we can to get the
&gt; other side to show up.
