Introduction to the Oakland Athletics Mailing List

Last update December 15, 1996

This file is available at any time by e-mailing to
    &lt;oak-athletics-request@plaidworks.com&gt; or by FTP as
    &lt;ftp://plaidworks.com/list-archives/oak-athletics/oak-athletics.INTRO&gt;

+++IMPORTANT+++
We ask that all users read this document and look at the charter for
what is acceptable use of this mailing list. We also ask that if you
haven't done so, send e-mail to &lt;manners@plaidworks.com&gt;. That file
contains the general rules we administer this list under, as well as
hints that we've found help people write e-mail messages which are
easier to understand and help the mailing lists function smoothly.

Everyone using these lists is expected to abide by the rules in these
files. We don't consider ignorance of the rules an excuse for
unacceptable behavior. Please work with us to make this a fun,
interesting and educational place to be. 
+++IMPORTANT+++

Administrative messages sent to the mailing lists will have a subject
that begins with "Admin:". Please read these messages, as they have
important information about the state of the lists and systems and
changes that might affect how you use it.

If you want to find out what else is available on this server, browse
&lt;http://www.plaidworks.com/ListAdmin/&gt; or send e-mail to
&lt;info@plaidworks.com&gt;. It will return a document listing all of our
services.

We have written a tutorial on using the listproc mail server. You can
get a copy of that by sending e-mail to
&lt;listproc-help@plaidworks.com&gt;.

============
1) The Oakland Athletics Mailing Lists
============

The "Oakland Athletics" mailing list is for general discussion of
issues and topics pertaining to the baseball team, it's farm system,
the organization, and other related things.

We are not affiliated with the Oakland Athletics in any way.

Please see the charters below for detailed descriptions of what is and
is not acceptable material for these lists.

There are other mailing lists available as well. Please send e-mail to
&lt;info@plaidworks.com&gt; to get a listing of their names, topics, and
subscription information.

============
2) Who to contact for help and advice
============
The List Mom (or Sysops) for these lists are:

    Chuq Von Rospach (e-mail: &lt;chuqui@plaidworks.com&gt;)

    Mailing List problems: &lt;postmaster@plaidworks.com&gt;

Please try to follow the directions. If you can't make things work,
drop us a note and we'll be happy to help. Try us second, though: we're
your helpers, not your baby-sitters. The time we spend doing
administrative things is time we can't spend creating better services
for you.

============
3) Subscription Info: Important Mail Server commands
============

To subscribe or unsubscribe to a mailing list, you should use the WWW
subscription site at &lt;http://www.plaidworks.com/ListAdmin/&gt;. If you
don't have WWW access (get it!), you must send an e-mail command to the
address &lt;listproc@plaidworks.com&gt;. Leave the subject line blank or put
a nonsense word in it -- do not put Listproc commands in the subject,
or Listproc will reject the message.  For complete details on using
listproc, get the listproc tutorial mentioned above.

Here are the listproc commands to subscribe to these mailing lists:
    SUBSCRIBE oak-athletics your real name goes here

Here are the commands to unsubscribe from these mailing lists:
    UNSUBSCRIBE oak-athletics

If you want to switch a list to digest mode, use these commands:
    SET oak-athletics MAIL DIGEST

If you want to switch a list from digest mode, use these commands:
    SET oak-athletics MAIL ACK

Remember, all listproc commands go to &lt;listproc@plaidworks.com&gt;, not
the main mailing list.

You can put more than one command in an e-mail message. Please note
that if your e-mail messages contain signatures, listproc will attempt
to read them as commands and return an error to you. This can be
ignored if you also get the confirmation back on the earlier commands.
You should get a confirmation e-mail or error warning for EVERY command
you send to listproc. If you didn't, something went wrong. Try it
again, and if it still doesn't work, contact &lt;postmaster@plaidworks.com&gt;
for help.

============
4) Sending messages to the mailing lists
============
To post to the mailing lists, send mail to the appropriate list address:
    &lt;oak-athletics@plaidworks.com&gt;

You must be a subscriber to the list to post to it. Listproc (the mail
server we use) is very picky about your address: it will not recognize
you as a subscriber except from the account where you sent the
SUBSCRIBE command from.

============
5) Charter: What's Acceptable, What's Not
============

There is a file of general rules and guidelines that we ask users to
abide by on these mailing lists. If you haven't done so send e-mail to
&lt;manners@plaidworks.com&gt; to get this list and please read it. We don't
consider ignorance of the rules an excuse for unacceptable behavior.
Please work with us to make this a fun, interesting and educational
place to be.

The "Oakland Athletics" mailing list is for general discussion of
issues and topics pertaining to the baseball team, it's farm system,
the organization, and other related things.

+++ Acceptable uses:

1) Information about the Oakland Athletics baseball club, it's minor
league farm system, management, and organization.

2) S.F. Oakland Athletics Collectibles and Merchandise information.
Please don't try to buy or sell stuff on the list, though. It's not a
classified ad or a swap meet.

3) Schedule information, box scores, team status, and transaction
reports.

4) Road Trips and group get-togethers. A way for out-of-towners to find
out what's happening when they visit, and for the locals to meet their
like-minded on-line fans.

5) Tickets for sale (and wanted). Scalping is not allowed, however.
Please see the note on this in the manners@plaidworks.com document.

6) Anything else of interest about the Oakland Athletics.

The oak-athletics list should be used for things specific to the
Oakland Athletics, primarily on-field issues. Anything that shifts away
from that towards more general baseball discussions or any
organizational discussions that don't involve the team specifically
should be put on baseball-chat.

One thing these lists are NOT for: this is not a place for the
discussion of rotisserie or fantasy baseball. Please do not come in
here looking for data on players you've drafted for a roto league, but
otherwise have no clue who they are. There are plenty of places for
that. This is for people who enjoy baseball as baseball.

Think of this as a sports bar, where we can all sit down with a drink
of our choice and discuss the game of our choice. Those who become too
rowdy, too drunk, too obnoxious or abusive will be shown the door.
Everyone else is welcome -- so drink in moderation, and act like an
adult. That's all we ask.

============
6) How to find the Home Page, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
============
This document is:
    &lt;ftp://plaidworks.com/list-archives/oak-athletics/oak-athletics.INTRO&gt;

If you aren't sure how to access the World Wide Web or FTP from your
site, please ask your local administrators for advice, since it varies
for different organizations and types of computers. If you can't get
help locally, drop private e-mail to one of the List Moms, and we'll do
what we can do to get you started.

The FTP archive is in the directory &lt;~ftp/list-archives/oak-athletics/&gt;.

All messages to the list are archived in the "message.archives" folder
in the subdirectory with the same name as the list you're looking for.
If you have WWW access, there will be a searchable database of the
message real soon now.
