Financial Cryptography 1997 (FC97):
The world's first financial cryptography conference, workshop, and exhibition.

CONFERENCE UPDATE: December 13, 1997
(The Banker's Edition...)

FC97 is sponsored by:

The Journal for Internet Banking and Commerce
&lt;http://www.arraydev.com/commerce/JIBC/&gt;
Offshore Information Services &lt;http://www.offshore.com.ai/&gt;

FC97 Conference and Exhibition,
February 24-28, 1997

FC97 Workshop for Senior Managers and IS Professionals
February 17-21, 1997

The Inter-Island Hotel
Anguilla, BWI

Conference Reservations: &lt;http://www.offshore.com.ai./fc97/&gt;



As previously announced, the world's  first peer-reviewed conference on
financial cryptography, FC97, will be held Monday through Friday,
February 24-28, 1997, from 8:30am until 12:30pm, at the Inter-Island
Hotel on the Carribbean island of Anguilla.

In conjunction with the conference, the Inter-Island Hotel will also be
the site of an intensive 40-hour workshop for senior managers and IS
professionals during the week preceding the conference (February 17-21),
and an exhibition for financial cryptography vendors, from 10am-6pm
during the week of the conference itself.

The goals of the combined conference, workshop, and exhibition are:

-- to provide a peer-reviewed forum for important research in financial
cryptography and the effects it will have on society,

-- to give senior managers and IS professionals a solid understanding of
the fundamentals of strong cryptgraphy as applied to financial
operations on public networks, and,

-- to showcase the newest products in financial cryptography.

In addition, plenty of time has been left open in the afternoon and
evening for sponsored corporate functions and activities, for business
networking, and, of course, for recreational activities on Anguilla
itself.

Conference participants are encouraged to bring their families.



The Conference

Ray Hirschfeld, the conference chair, has picked an outstanding group of
professionals and researchers in financial cryptography and in related
fields to review the papers for this conference.

They are:

Chairman: Rafael Hirschfeld, CWI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

Matthew Franklin, AT&amp;T Laboratories--Research, Murray Hill, NJ, USA
Michael Froomkin, U. Miami School of Law, Coral Gables, FL, USA
Arjen Lenstra, Citibank, New York, NY, USA
Mark Manasse, Digital Equipment Corporation, Palo Alto, CA, USA
Kevin McCurley, Sandia Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, USA
Charles Merrill, McCarter &amp; English, Newark, NJ, USA
Clifford Neuman, Information Sciences Institute, Marina del Rey, CA, USA
Sholom Rosen, Citibank, New York, NY, USA
Israel Sendrovic, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, NY, USA

Some of the names may be recognizable to you. If they're not, included
in that list are the inventor of Millicent, the project manager of EU's
CAFE digital cash project, the holders of Citicorp's digital cash
patent, two famous scholars in cryptography and digital commerce law,
the President of International Association for Cryptologic Research, and
the Chairman of the Taskforce on the Security of Electronic Money for
the G-10 Central Banks.

The actual agenda of the conference will be determined by the papers the
program committee selects, so we won't have a final schedule for the
conference until the middle of January. However, the conference
committee is selecting papers in what it considers the union, and not
the intersection, of the fields of finance and cryptography.

The Final Call for Papers was issued a few weeks ago, and the submission
process for papers is now closed. The committee chairman sends his
thanks to all of you who submitted papers for consideration. Given the
volume of submissions, and the quality of the authors, this inaugural
conference should be a very interesting one indeed.

To refresh your memory, the program committee solicited papers in the
following topic areas:

    Anonymous Payments                      Fungibility
    Authentication                          Home Banking
    Communication Security                  Identification
    Conditional Access                      Implementations
    Copyright Protection                    Loss Tolerance
    Credit/Debit Cards                      Loyalty Mechanisms
    Currency Exchange                       Legal Aspects
    Digital Cash                            Micropayments
    Digital Receipts                        Network Payments
    Digital Signatures                      Privacy Issues
    Economic Implications                   Regulatory Issues
    Electronic Funds Transfer               Smart Cards
    Electronic Purses                       Standards
    Electronic Voting                       Tamper Resistance
    Electronic Wallets                      Transferability

Financial Cryptography '97 is held in cooperation with the International
Association for Cryptologic Research. The conference proceedings will be
published on the web by the Journal for Internet Banking and Commerce.
&lt;http://www.arraydev.com/commerce/JIBC/&gt;.

For further information on the submission process, which is, again, now
closed, please see the program committee's web-page at
&lt;http://www.cwi.nl/conferences/FC97&gt;.


As we mentioned before, the conference will be covered by Wired
Magazine, and will be the featured conference in it's January 1997
"Deductible Junkets" section. So, if you have already decided to come to
FC97, please register and make your plane and hotel reservations as
soon as possible. Conference, workshop, and exhibit space is extremely
limited. Wired's January issue comes out near the end of December, and we
expect there to be something of a rush at that time.

The price of a pass to the conference sessions and exhibits is $1,000
U.S. You can pay for your FC97 conference ticket with Visa or MasterCard
at the regstriation site: &lt;http://www.offshore.com.ai/fc97/&gt;

The price includes breakfast at the conference, some stipends for
presenters who need them, and the logistics of having a professional
conference with high-bandwidth internet connectivity in a location like
Anguilla. In looking around, however, the conference organizers *did*
notice that FC97 price is in keeping with other business and
professional technology conferences of similar total session length.

You can register, and pay for, your conference ticket at:

&lt;http://www.offshore.com.ai/fc97/&gt;


The Exhibition

Concurrent with the conference will be the the FC97 Exhibition, a small
trade show for financial cryptography products and services. Each booth
will have high bandwidth access to the internet, and will get 2
conference passes. Booth prices start at $5,000 US. Please contact Julie
Rackliffe at &lt;mailto: rackliffe@tcm.org&gt; for further information . As
space is limited, please register as soon as possible if you plan to be
there.


The Workshop

We are especially honored to have Ian Goldberg as the leader of the FC97
Workshop, which will run one week prior to the conference, February
17-21, 1997.

Ian, the cryptographer at Berkeley who was made famous last year (in
articles in both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times) for
breaking Netscape's transaction security protocols, will be running an
intensive, 5-day workshop for senior managers and technology
professionals. Someone likened it to a financial cryptography
"boot-camp".

While the workshop is still being developed, and will depend on the
skills of the planned participants, workshop topics will include, but
not be limited to:

Overview and background of cryptography
Survey of existing and proposed Internet payment systems
Details on some specific payment systems
Issues involved in setting up a secure Internet site
A step-by-step walkthrough of setting up an ecash-enabled Web server.

Ian has recruited a strong roster of instructors with credentials
similar to his own, and, as he plans to maintain a 5-1 student/teacher
ratio, the size of the workshop will be restricted and advance
registration will be required.

Further information about the workshop can be found at:

&lt;http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~iang/fc97/workshop.html&gt;

The planned price for the workshop is $5,000. This covers lab space,
hardware, network access, software, and, of course, 40 hours of
instruction and structured lab activity. The lab itself will be open 24
hours a day, if demand warrants it.

Sponsorship Opportunities

FC97 offers sponsorship opportunities at all levels. Corporations are
encouraged to to be an exclusive sponsor for lunch or dinner, each of
which will be followed by a recreational activity of some kind. Sponsors
will have the opportunity to permanently attach their name to these
networking functions, which the organizers hope will be a large part of
the conference experience. There are 10 such events being planned, and
10 corporations will be accepted for sponsorship. Corporate sponsors of
these events will also get a substantial initial discount on exhibit
space, and complimentary conference tickets.

In-kind sponsorship is also available at all levels of support, with
opportunities for companies to provide networking, bandwidth, hardware,
radio pocket modems and equipment, as well as design and print services,
transportation, and other things. If you've got it and you think we'll
need it, please contact us.

The sponsorship contact is Julie Rackliffe &lt;mailto: rackliffe@tcm.org&gt;.



Air Transportation and Hotels

Air travel to Anguilla is typically done through San Juan, St. Thomas or
St. Maarten/Martin. There are several non-stop flights a day from various
US and European locations. Connection through to Anguilla can be made
through American Eagle, or through LIAT. See your travel agent for details.
American Eagle Airlines has agreed to increase their flights as needed to
accomodate any extra traffic the conference brings to the island.

Anguilla's runway is 3600 feet, with a displaced threshold of 600 feet,
and can accomodate business jets. Obviously, you should talk to your
aviation staff for details about your own aircraft's capabilities in this
regard.

Anguilla import duties are not imposed on hardware or software which
will leave the island again, so, as long as you take it with you when
you leave, you won't pay import duties.

Hotels range from spartan to luxurious, and more information about
hotels on Anquilla can be obtained from your travel agent, or at
&lt;http://www.offshore.com.ai/fc97/&gt;.
