Dear Friend,

If you are interested in increasing your income by using your personal
contacts, Please Consider this... Make up to $400.00 per deal by
giving away security systems

Secure America Highlights

1.  It only cost $45 to become a distributor and for that you receive
a black glove leather brief case with everything you need to get
started;  forms, full color brochures, and a video tape telling you
about the company, its product and marketing plan.

2. The company offers 100% financing to those buying the product- they
have four institutions and can finance most everyone.  If your
prospective customer gets turned down, then with a small down payment,
the company will finance them - IN OTHER WORDS, - ALMOST NO TURN
DOWNS!    Each source, including the "company carried' contracts, will
be reported to TRW; thus helping people, who have bad or no credit,
gain the good credit they deserve.

3.  The customer receives the system for FREE when they agree to a
$29.95 per month-four year monitoring agreement, which is standard
cost for a 2-way voice monitoring.  They need to agree to either a
debit from their checking account or credit card each month.

4.  You as the distributor receive a commission of up to $400 - once
the buyer is approved and financed.  The company pays commission
weekly.  The commission is paid even before the buyer makes their
first payment.  And this is important.  There are never any charge
backs!

5.  You, as the distributor can sign up others distributors and
receive bonuses of $120 to $320 per sale from distributors under you.
The marketing plan offers a very attractive bonus plan.  By signing up
one new distributor, who does the same within a month, and this
pattern continues with each new person only bringing one new
distributor, there would be more than 4,000 distributors in your
organization at the end of a year.  Keep in mind that you only brought
in one person each month.  If each person in your organization sold
only one system per month, your income would be more than $800,000 the
first year!  What if your organization only did 1/3 of that?  Would
you be excited?

6.  You can set up businesses who can give these away as premiums to
their customers, Carpet dealers, appliance dealers, auto dealers, real
estate offices, home improvement companies, just to name a few, can
give their customers a certificate for a free system upon activation
of a four year monitoring contract.  The certificate  will have your
name on it and all they have to do is contact you for the system.  You
get them approved and get the commission - It's that simple!  If you
want, you can pay the business a referral fee of say $25, $50, or $100
or even better yet sign them up as a distributor and get continuing
overrides and bonuses on them.

7.  No Installation worries on your part.  The system is wireless,
needs no professional installer and comes with an installation video
that walks the customer through the installation process. Installation
will take about 20-30 minutes.

8.  You can market to both home owners and renters - in fact, nobody
is going after the rental market at this time.  Think about it, do
renters want any less protection than homeowners?  What a gold mine!
When someone moves, they take their security system with them and set
it up, with our nationwide monitoring company, at their new location
(keep in mind that the system is hooked up to the customers' regular
phone line).  

9.  No Inventory.  You do not have to buy anything or make a huge
investments in products just to store  them in your garage.  Once you
sign someone up for a system, you turn the paperwork into the company,
they process the application (usually within 48 hours),  and ship the
system to the customer - no deliver or installation hassles for you!

10.  No Accounting.  The company keeps track of everything for you and
give you a computer printout of your sales and organizational activity
each month.

11.  The Need.  September 17, 1996 U.S. Justice Department statistics
show that last year burglaries, theft, and theft of motor vehicles
were 288 per 1,000 households and yet only 15% of the homes in America
have security systems.  We can offer monitored protection and peace of
mind for only $1 a day and save 10-20% on home insurance premiums.

12.  The Equipment.  TWO-WAY VOICE  systems let the monitoring company
listen throughout the home (after alarm activation) for burglaries,
medical, or emergency needs, or fire department help.  In fact more
and more cities are starting to charge non two-way system owners for
false alarms.

13.  The Company.  Secure America has spent more than two years in
developing this state of the art equipment system, marketing plan, and
available $100 million in financing.  This is a one of a king company
- no inventory to stock - no huge investments - no money up from the
buyer - weekly payment of sales bonuses - and there is NO Competition
for this type of system at this price.

14.  The Opportunity.  What a great feeling!  We get to Give Away a
system that can do so much for family safety and peace of mind.  And
whether you would like to make an extra $300 a month or have visions
of grandeur, this program can satisfy your needs.  The financial
bottom line...  There will be many millionaires made through Secure
America in the next few years.
