I never really liked having my ass kissed much, so I'll find out the 
truth tomorrow.

I got a fax sent from a Senate office yesterday saying that it was in the
platform, even though it doesn't appear (yet) on the rnc.org web site --
a fact you'll note I mentioned in my original message. 

It was a good rant, though, Rich. Nicely done.

&gt; &gt; But the benefit of having a pro-privacy statement in the platform (which in
&gt; &gt; fact was watered down significantly from that originally proposed by
&gt; &gt; advocates on our side) is that the platform covers Republican Party
&gt; &gt; candidates for any office, not just the presidency.
&gt; 
&gt; One Republican staffer sent you an ass-kissing note quoting an ALLEGED piece
&gt; of the platform WHICH IS NOT ACTUALLY THERE. The platform was finalized on
&gt; August 12th. The text you quoted is not even in the list of rejected
&gt; amendments. I assume that either you or the staffer you talked to innocently
&gt; mistook some Senator's position paper for the platform; it's hard to believe
&gt; that anyone would intentionally lie about something that is so trivial to
&gt; check.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if the text you passed on were part of the platform, I fail to see the
&gt; importance of a feel-good statement in a platform that the party's
&gt; presidential candidate CLAIMS NOT TO HAVE EVEN READ.
&gt; 
&gt; Also from the Republican Platform (perhaps out of context, but unlike the
&gt; text some anonymous alleged Republican staffer sent you, this is actually
&gt; in the platform): 
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; In a Dole Administration, U. S. Attorneys will prosecute and jail those who
&gt; prey upon the innocent. We support upgrading our interdiction effort by
&gt; establishing a Deputy Commissioner for Drug Enforcement within the Customs
&gt; Service. We will intensify our intelligence efforts against international
&gt; drug traffickers and use whatever means necessary to destroy their
&gt; operations and seize their personal accounts.
&gt; 
&gt; We support strong penalties, including mandatory minimum sentences, for drug
&gt; trafficking, distribution and drug-related crimes.  Drug use is closely
&gt; related to crime and recidivism. Drug testing should be made a routine
&gt; feature of the criminal justice process at every stage, including the
&gt; juvenile justice system. Test results should be used in deciding pretrial
&gt; release, sentencing, and probation revocation.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; Terrorist states have made a comeback during Bill Clinton's Administration. 
&gt; He has treated their rulers with undue respect and failed to curb their
&gt; acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.  Although congressional
&gt; Republicans passed anti-terrorism legislation earlier this year, the Clinton
&gt; Administration has not implemented many key provisions of the law. It has
&gt; not been used to freeze terrorists' assets, deny terrorists' visas, cut off
&gt; foreign aid to supporters of terrorist states, or halt terrorist fundraising
&gt; in the United States. The Clinton Administration has not implemented the
&gt; anti-terrorist research program established and funded by Congress in the
&gt; 1990 Aviation Security Act.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; Our technological edge is at risk not only because of the Clinton
&gt; Administration's refusal to sustain an adequate investment in defense
&gt; modernization, but also its virtual abandonment of national security-related
&gt; export controls.  Acquisition of technology by aspiring proliferators of
&gt; weapons of mass destruction has been irresponsibly facilitated. A Republican
&gt; Administration will protect the American technological edge. It will do so
&gt; by expanding investment in defense modernization, ensuring that the Defense
&gt; Department has a key role in approving exports of militarily critical
&gt; technology, and restoring the effectiveness of export control regimes.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; The intelligence community should be our first line of defense against
&gt; terrorism, drug trafficking, nuclear proliferation, and foreign espionage.
&gt; Bill Clinton's neglect of our country's intelligence service is one of his
&gt; most serious sins of omission. He has underfunded, misutilized, and
&gt; marginalized critical intelligence missions and capabilities. No wonder his
&gt; first appointee as Director of Central Intelligence has endorsed Bob Dole.
&gt; The nation's security - and the personal safety of our citizens - cannot be
&gt; placed at risk.
&gt; 
&gt; Effective intelligence can be expensive. But what it costs is measured in
&gt; dollars rather than lives - an important lesson of the Gulf War. A
&gt; Republican Administration will reverse the decline in funding for
&gt; intelligence personnel and operations while better managing the development
&gt; of futuristic capabilities. We will not constrain U.S. intelligence
&gt; personnel with "politically correct"  standards that impede their ability to
&gt; collect and act on intelligence information. We will conduct whatever
&gt; intelligence operations are necessary to safeguard American lives against
&gt; the terrorists who bomb our airplanes and buildings.
