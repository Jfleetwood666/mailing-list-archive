-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The first alpha release of the WinSock Remailer is now available via
e-mail.  Due to problems setting up user authentication on my homepage
at

  http://www.c2.net/~winsock/

I have decided to distribute it via e-mail until I can get user 
authentication working.

In order for you to receive the WinSock Remailer, I have to be reasonably 
sure that you are a US or Canadian citizen or permanent resident.  
Therefore, you will need to review a copy of the License Agreement and 
fill out the required information.  Then clear-sign the agreement with PGP 
and mail it to me at jgrasty@gate.net.  Don't forget to tell me where I can
find your PGP public key so that I can check the signature.  No signed
license agreement, no remailer.

In order for me to have a good feeling that you are not a foreign national,
I need to have the following information check out:

a.  Verify that your address is within the boundaries of the US or Canada.
    I will do this by checking if you are in a public address database such
    as "88 Million Households Phone Book".
b.  Verify that your name and e-mail address is the same as in your public 
    key.

This is basically the same method that Netscape is using at:

  http://wwwus.netscape.com/eng/US-Current/

to verify citizenship or permanent residency, but the process is not
automated.

I don't like having to enforce clearly unconstitutional ITAR regulations,
but I'm not ready for an extended stay at Club Fed.

2. JOEY GRASTY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF THIS

SOFTWARE OR ISSUE ANY UPDATES IN THE FUTURE.

3. While Joey Grasty intends to distribute a commercial release of the
Software, Joey Grasty reserves the right at any time not to release a
commercial release of the Software or, if released, to alter prices,
features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms,
release dates, general availability or any other characteristics of the
commercial release as he sees fit.

4. Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to
the Software shall remain in Joey Grasty and/or its suppliers.  You agree
to abide by the copyright law and all other applicable laws of the
United States including, but not limited to, export control laws.

5. Joey Grasty may terminate this License at any time by delivering notice

erasing your copy of the Software and notifying Joey Grasty of this action
forthwith.  This License is personal to you and you agree not to assign your 
rights herein.  This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance

6. Use, duplication or disclosure by the Government of any locality, state

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (b) FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. FURTHERMORE,
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
YOU.

9.  HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.  The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not
designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control
equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such
as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or
communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines,
or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Software could lead
directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
damage ("High Risk Activities").  Joey Grasty and its suppliers specifically
disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk
Activities.

Clear-sign this agreement with your PGP public key and e-mail it to 
jgrasty@gate.net.
