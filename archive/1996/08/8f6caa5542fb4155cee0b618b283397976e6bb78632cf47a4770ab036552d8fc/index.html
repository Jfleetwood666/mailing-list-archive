Two messages were sent from my account to dc-stuff having me taking 
credit for email bombs against certain people, namely: Jeff Slaton, 
Captain Crunch and the Cyberangels.

I first became aware of these emails after receiving a message from 
Emmanuel Goldstein asking about who was doing this, as his email box was 
being slaughtered at that very moment.

I *DID NOT* email bomb anyone. This is going to be hard to believe since 
those mentioned as targets of annihilation were people I have fucked with 
in the past very openly on dc-stuff. This combined with the current 
"blame everything on se7en" attitude makes it very hard for anyone to 
take this professed innocence seriously.

I called my SysAdmin this morning at 4:00 AM PST and he ran through the 
logs of my account. The emails did in fact come from my account, but, the 
logs show unusual activity which can't be accounted for by either side. 
Fortunately, the logs show that the actual bombing was not done from my 
account.

I was on IRC for several hours talking to trusted friends while this all 
happened. Whoever penetrated my account knew what the hell they were 
doing in respects to log modification. A re-install is in process as well 
as a tightening of overall site security, especially my account.

I am not really upset other than my email account was used to take credit 
for something I didn't do. My account could have been used for more 
nefarious purposes; it wasn't. Veterans of dc-stuff know I am not afraid 
to take credit for the things I do. I did not do this. But I will also 
not lose any sleep over the Spam King being hit. Captain Crunch: well, 
after all is said and done, he is harmless. Same with the CyberAngels: 
they can talk the talk, but can't walk the walk. I have proved that many 
times. In the end, they are harmless also. Hitting them wouldn't 
accomplish anything tangible.

At this time, the initial mail headers show the attack was launched via 
sun.dmci.com from either a netcom.com or an io.* domain. No doubt the 
account used to launch the attack was hacked. The identity of the bomber 
may never be known. All I know is that it wasn't me. Take it for what's 
it worth. Time will vindicate me, as time always does. I just hope it's 
sooner than later. Hold your judgement of me until such time.

And while dis.org has been recently compromised, I wouldn't be so quick 
to blame this on the same people. I have had intermediary contact with 
Galf sufficient for me to believe he made his point and has moved on, 
having not been responsible for this latest wave of email impersonation. 
Recent logs have shown that a kind of "open season" has been declared 
upon dis.org by every newbie out there that has heard of recent events. I 
say newbie because none of the recent attempts to gain access have proved 
successful.

I used to laugh about email bombing. But when it happens and you are 
caught up in it, it is not funny. If any of you out there think it is, 
wait until you find tens of thousands of messages in your inbox and an 
incoming rate of 750 per minute, every minute. Scripts will not save you.
