This is long enough.  I've been brutal and cut sections less
likely to promote discussion.

                   Strengthening Remailer Protocols

STATUS OF THIS MEMO

This memo proposes improvements for the Mixmaster protocol and
requests discussion and further suggestions.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

INTRODUCTION

Lance Cottrell's documents [1] and [2] describe the current Mixmaster
protocol and attacks against it.  This memo began as a response to
those thoughts, but has developed in discussion with Cottrell.


SPAMMING ATTACK

[2] describes an active attack where many messages are sent to an
honest remailer to separate a message of interest from other
traffic.  The aim is to clear other messages out of the message pool,
wait for the target and finally eject that from the pool.  The target
message is identified because the attacker can recognise  his own
messages.

Attempts to defeat this attack could well be based on preventing the
attacker from recognising his own messages.  That is the approach
taken here.

     RE-ENCRYPTION AS A SPAM DEFENCE
     
     In this diagram remailer 'A' has received a message addressed to
     himself.  Inside that is one to 'B' - unreadable to A.  Further
     layers are hidden of course.

                AB?????  decrypts to B?????

     This means that our remailer can only disguise the message by
     re-encrypting it on the outside.  But the message has got to
     make some net progress toward delivery.  The trick is that a
     remailer can find the outer two headers addressed to him and
     process both of them.  Two headers processed and one rewound is net
     progress.  When the header rewound is addressed to the same
     recipient as was next on the list anyway the diagram looks like
     this.

     Actions at 'A':            AB????? decrypts to  B?????
                                 B????? encrypts to BB?????

     Actions at 'B':            BB?????  decrypts to B?????
                                         decrypts to  C????
                                         encrypts to CC????

     The beauty of this is that it is compatible with the existing
     protocol.  If a remailer only knows about removing layers of
     encryption it still fits into a network where some can do both
     actions.  Whether it sends or receives the message it still
     works.


     RE-ENCRYPTION IN THE MIXMASTER ROTATING QUEUE MODEL
     
     Instead of layers like an onion, Mixmaster has a queue of
     headers that get rotated.  A used header goes to the back of the
     queue where it can never again be read.  At some point the
     header at the front of the queue is found to be the last one,
     and the message is sent on its final hop.

     For a header queue the above actions look like this:

     Actions at 'A':        AAAB???  -&gt; AAB???a
                                     -&gt; AB???aa
                                     -&gt; BB???aa

     In general when the first H headers are addressed to the
     remailer reading them, (H-1) rotations will be performed, and
     the top header will be overwritten with another one with a
     random key and IV to encrypt the rest of the message.  The
     number of headers present remains 20, however many or few of
     these are still to be read.  No valid header block is ever
     overwritten, only used header blocks that are good for nothing.
     This is always possible because after a remailer receives a
     message at least the one header it has just read must be of no
     further use.

     This will hide the message content from eavesdroppers, but not
     from the next remailer in line - 'B'.  Assume that remailer B
     is operated by an attacker, and that he directs spam messages
     there after host A (which is holding your message in the pool at
     the time of the attack).  B can read all messages sent by the
     attacker (who knows B's private key).  This is also why I think
     link encryption offers incomplete protection.

     RE-ENCRYPTION WITH CHEATERS

     Mixmaster assumes that no particular remailer in the network can
     be trusted and that the user does not know which remailers
     cheat.  The message passes through a chain of remailers, who aim
     to hide information from each other so that the compromise of
     some of them will not disclose the original sender and final
     destination.

     Central to the spamming attack is the idea that the attacker can
     recognise the messages he is trying to trace.  This is done by
     eliminating  his own messages.   The whole set - not just
     some of them.  It can be arranged that the attacker does not
     obtain the whole set until it is too late to trace the target
     message (i.e. after a few hops, when it is likely to have met other
     legitimate traffic).  The partial information the attacker obtains
     before all the spams are identified will be of some use, but
     following each of several leads with a new spam attack is unappealing
     as the number of suspect messages will just grow.

     The remailer needs the freedom to divert packets to another
     remailer.  This is shown below; where remailer C was chosen at
     random.

     Actions at 'A':        AAAB???  -&gt; AAB???a
                                     -&gt; AB???aa
                                     -&gt; CB???aa

     Each remailer could have three options when sending a packet to
     its next host.

        1) rotate all possible headers, and send the result  (current protocol)
        2) re-encrypt message with new 3DES key and IV.  Do not divert.
        3) re-encrypt message with new 3DES key and IV.  Divert at random.
     
     Good probabilities for these options might be:

        1) 20%   P(1) = P(3)  The number of headers the next host can read
                 should not reveal whether a diversion has just been made.
                 (We care about this because it discourages cheaters
                  deliberately refusing to pass on your mail.)
        2) 60%   Other outgoing packets are not distinguishable from spams.
        3) 20%   Should not approach 100%.
                 (To arrive is better than to travel in hope.)
     
     A spam attack as described in [2] would use many more packets
     than those in the message pool (N) on the host under attack.  The
     number of spam packets diverted to honest remailers (a
     proportion R of the whole) would be about

		 MANY  . N  . P(3) . R

     and those diverted twice in succession to honest remailers would
     be about

		 MANY  . N  . P(3) . P(3) . R . R

     and I'd expect a figure above 5 here to thwart the spammer, because
     of the time taken to collect the 5 spams.

     This diversion (adding steps to the middle of a chain) seems different
     from a Middleman scheme [3] where extra hops are added at the end.

     This scheme does NOT allow a remailer to choose the rest of the
     chain to be followed.  A dishonest remailer cannot bypass any
     remailer chosen by the original sender (in the hope of following
     the message to its destination) using only cooperating dishonest
     remailers) because the message has been encrypted in the public
     key of each remailer the sender chose before it entered the
     network.
