I also wonder why universal service is such a Good Thing. It also, 
unfortunately, is on the agendas for the G-7-type meetings of information 
ministers from participating countries. http://www.eff.org/~declan/global/

(My objections to universal service are perhaps not surprising. It
devolves more power into the hands of the DC bureaucrats such as the FCC,
and provides a slippery slope on which we can slide down towards more and
more government regulation. By concentrating regulatory authority in the
Federal government, it also makes decisions more subsceptible to
special-interest lobbying and political patronage. But I recall Ronda has
been arguing for universal service for some time now, including on the
netizens mailing list.)

&gt; 
&gt; Report 1
&gt; 
&gt; I just returned from a fascinating week in Montreal, Canada where I
&gt; attended the INET '96 conference held by the Internet Society. I will
&gt; try to write some reports about what happened at the Conference in the
&gt; next week or two as it would be good to have the online community
&gt; discuss some of the issues that were raised at the Conference.
&gt; 
&gt; What became clear at the conference was that this is an important 
&gt; time in the development of the Internet. People from around the 
&gt; world attended the conference and most expressed the desire that
&gt; the Internet be made available in their countries for education
&gt; and scientific and other uses. Some of the focus of the conference
&gt; was on business uses of the Internet, but it seemed that there was
&gt; a great concern among the people I spoke to that the Internet be
&gt; available for educational and scientific and government and 
&gt; community purposes, not just for business uses.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to start this report however, with the last talk that was
&gt; given at the conference. The final talk was to be given by Reed Hunt
&gt; of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. He didn't attend
&gt; however, and instead the talk was given by Blair Levin, Chief of 
&gt; Staff at the FCC instea.
&gt; 
&gt; A version of the talk is available at the FCC www site. 
&gt; 
&gt; The talk was a surprise as it seemed uninformed both about the 
&gt; history and importance of the Internet and of the important public
&gt; policy considerations that need to be taken into account when making
&gt; any rules for regulating the Internet. 
&gt; 
&gt; At the beginning of the talk, there was the statement that Reed Hunt
&gt; was the first FCC Chairman to have a computer on his desk, but that 
&gt; he asked his staff to explain how the Internet works. So instead
&gt; of a commitment to learn about how the Internet developed and the 
&gt; significant impact it is having on the world, the speech presented
&gt; us with the glib "the Internet gives us the opportunity to change
&gt; all our communications policies."
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with this is that the FCC is therefore starting from
&gt; scratch, throwing out all the lessons that have helped the Internet
&gt; to grow and develop, and instead, creating its own models.
&gt; 
&gt; In his talk Blair Levin listed five principles. They were:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) How can public policy promote expansion of band width?
&gt; 2) What rules can we get rid of or have?
&gt; 3) The concern with pricing.
&gt; 4) How to make sure it reaches everyone, especially kids in schools.
&gt; 5) How to make sure it reaches across the globe.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with this was that it took universal service as the 4th
&gt; point, and then basically substituted access by kids in schools for
&gt; the principle of universal service.
&gt; 
&gt; During the talk Blair described how the NTIA (the National
&gt; Telecommunications Information Administration) had submitted an
&gt; important paper to the FCC on the issue of voice over the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; This made clear that the NTIA has not submitted any paper to the FCC
&gt; on the issue of universal service, despite the fact that they held an
&gt; online hearing on several issues, including universal service and the
&gt; Internet, in November 1994 and the NTIA has done nothing to act on the
&gt; broad expression of sentiment for universal service that was expressed
&gt; during that online public meeting.
&gt; 
&gt; When asked about that online meeting, Blair said that the FCC knew of
&gt; the meeting. However, it seems to have had no effect on their
&gt; deliberations, or on the request of people that the FCC open up their
&gt; decision making process so that the people who are being affected by
&gt; their decisions have a means of providing input into those decisions.
&gt; 
&gt; In response to a question about the need for universal service Blair
&gt; responded that that was the obligation of other branches of the
&gt; U.S. government like the Department of Education.
&gt; 
&gt; He said this despite the fact that at the current moment the FCC is
&gt; supposedly making rules to provide for the universal service
&gt; provisions of the Telecommunications Act passed by the U.S. Congress
&gt; in Feb. 1996.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, he claimed to welcome submissions into their process, but when
&gt; told that it would cost over $50 to pay postage costs for a submission
&gt; since there were over 35 people who had to be served (and postage on a
&gt; minimal submission was $1.45), he said to see Kevin Werbach a lawyer
&gt; at the FCC, who had come with him. Kevin Werbach offered no means of
&gt; dealing with the high cost of making a submission.
&gt; 
&gt; Many people at the Internet Society Conference applauded in response
&gt; to the question about the lack of concern by the FCC for the principle
&gt; of universal service to the Internet. At the Internet Society
&gt; conference many people spoke up about the need in their countries,
&gt; whether that be Canada, or Norway, or Ghana, etc. for the Net to be
&gt; more widespread and available to the public for educational and
&gt; community purposes. Many were concerned about the lack of ability of
&gt; the so called "market forces" to provide networking access to other
&gt; than corporate or well to do users. Yet here was a talk being given in
&gt; the name of the Chairman of the regulatory body in the U.S. charged
&gt; with making the rules to provide for universal service, and the talk
&gt; was unconcerned with the important issues and problems that issue of
&gt; providing universal service to the Internet raises.
&gt; 
&gt; It is unfortunate that Reed Hunt didn't come to the conference and
&gt; take the challenge to learn what the real concerns of people around
&gt; the world are with regard to access to the Internet. Isolated in
&gt; Washington, with no access to him possible for most people (though
&gt; someone from one company told me that he was told to send him email
&gt; whenever he had a concern), it seems difficult for the rules process
&gt; to be able to produce any helpful outcome. There need to be open
&gt; meetings and sessions where people who are concerned with these issues
&gt; are invited to be heard and to discuss these issues with the
&gt; FCC. Instead the process is going on behind the same closed doors that
&gt; the crafting of the Telecommunications Act was created by the
&gt; U.S. Congress.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a tribute to the Internet Society that they did make an effort
&gt; to invite government officials like Reed Hunt to the conference.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCC will be setting an example for the rest of the world by the
&gt; telecommunications policy rules it creates. Will the policy be one
&gt; that recognizes that the so called "market" cannot provide the free or
&gt; low cost access to the Internet that is necessary to make such
&gt; universal service a reality? Will the rules created be based on
&gt; looking back at how time sharing and the the ARPANET and the Internet
&gt; developed so it can build on those lessons?  To have those rules be
&gt; based on firm lessons from the past and firm principles that can make
&gt; them fruitful, it is necessary that the FCC process creating those
&gt; rules be much more open than it is at present. If the FCC could learn
&gt; from the experience of the Internet and set up newsgroups and real
&gt; email access to the officials involved that would demonstrate a
&gt; commitment to a more equitable access to the Internet and to the fcc
&gt; rulemaking that is needed to make the Internet available to all. But
&gt; from the recent talk by the FCC official presented at INET '96, there
&gt; seems little indication that the need for an open process and a many
&gt; to many means of communication is recognized among those at the FCC
&gt; and thus there is even less evidence that the FCC is capable of making
&gt; rules to apply the principle of universal service to make Internet
&gt; access available to all.
