I have really scrambled up the quotes from verious people.  My appologies
if you think I have misrepresented your viewpoints.

One of NSA's traditional roles is to automatically scan communications and
pull out the "interesting" stuff.  To continue this role, they have to be
able to decrypt the messages.  I wouldn't, particularly when thinking in
paranoid mode, assume they have given up on that role.

&gt;&gt;Now I have no problem with believing NSA would invest $7 million.  However,
&gt;&gt;$700 million makes me wonder.  With FPGAs, there is a significant risk that
&gt;&gt;people will change the crypto system and make the investment worthless.
&gt;&gt;(Which, I guess, is why they prefer general purpose computers.)  However,
&gt;&gt;if they can get the equivalent of a few bits of key back by cryptanalysis,
&gt;&gt;then they knock the costs down to entirely reasonable (for them) levels.

I was assuming program only once chips, like the old burn-the-fuse PROMs. 
If you are ordering in quantity 700,000, for the RC4-40 engine, then you
have no need to worry about the cost of small runs of Mask programmed
chips.

&gt;I conclude, roughly speaking, that spending $100 M on a specialized machine

&gt;lengths used) would not even give them pause.

If they are using Programmable-only-once Gate Arrays or Mask programmed
ones, $700 million for a machine which will cost $7 million for a simple
reprogramming might give them pause.  Or at least make them consider if
there is an alternative.  If they are using easily reprogrammable arrays,
then they have a general purpose computer specialized for certain types of
parallel processing.  If this machine cost $100 million, I agree they would
probably build it.

&gt;Those estimates assume that a single FPGA can break RC4 in hours.  I think
&gt;that is an extremely optimistic assumption, given the available public
&gt;information.  But perhaps NSA is orders of magnitude ahead of us in chip
&gt;design (unlikely) or orders of magnitude ahead of us in RC4 cryptanalysis
&gt;(and we're back to paranoid musings).

&gt;&gt; If we assume a machine designed to break *every* message, NSA's response
&gt;&gt; makes more sense.

I feel like I'm leaning over backwards to defend NSA's response, an
extremely uncomfortable position (and I could crack my skull when I fall)
:-).  The most important issue is, what is NSA's state of the art.  If we
accept their $1000/FPGA chip, then they are indeed at the bleeding edge,
and suffering from the associated low chip yields.  If they are at the best
cost-performance point for 2-3 years ago or whenever they started approving
the export of RC4-40, then they are certainly subject to David Wagner's
performance limits.

A number of people have mentioned the heat problems.  I, and I think also
NSA, never said they couldn't be solved, but solving them involves
engineering costs, whether it is to design cooling or distribution
techniques.  I think the bullets in their response were primarily to
justify that $10 million NRE cost.  (Getting to $10 million isn't hard on a
government project.)

&gt;One of the speakers ... was the Product Line Manager from Xilinx and one of

&gt;quantities) so here is a little update on the state of the art in this area.
&gt;
&gt;The interconnection problem has also been solved in this chip series. ...
&gt;Given the relatively compact design in Ian and
&gt;Dave's paper and the new chips one might even fit two or four cracking
&gt;engines on a single FPGA.
&gt;
&gt;The newest line from
&gt;Xilinx, the XC6000 series has the capability to be reconfigured either
&gt;partially or completely from an on-chip cache in 5 ns.  That is five
&gt;nanoseconds and you have a completely different piece of virtual hardware. If
&gt;the configuration is loaded through the slowest I/O port on the chip it only
&gt;takes 200 microseconds.

Given this kind of hardware, the only reasonable assumption is that if NSA
hasn't built a general purpose cracking engine, they will.


&gt;Even if the encryption algorithm is secret these
&gt;chips open up interesting posiblities for developing general-purpose
&gt;cryptanalysis machines. [Hmm, there may be a paper in there... "Evolving A
&gt;General-Purpose Cryptanalysis Engine"...]

The idea of a genetic system to "learn" an unknown cypher system and then
brute force crack it is indeed worth a paper, perhaps several.
