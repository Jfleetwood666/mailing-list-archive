                       EXECUTIVE ORDER 13010
                     Creates Terrorist Gestapo
                   ----------------------------
                  CHICAGO BRACING FOR TERRORISTS!

                Police State Reactivated In Chicago
                     Is The Nation Far Behind?
                -----------------------------------
         Will Clinton Use EO# 13010 To Declare Martial Law?
         --------------------------------------------------
 
Later this month, the  Democratic  Convention returns to Chicago.
When it was there in 1968, the country was  ablaze  in  anti-Viet
Nam  War  fever.   Anti-war  demonstrators  all  but  brought the
convention and Chicago to their knees.
 
In today's world,  demonstrators  are  labeled terrorists.  Armed
with today's stronger "label," the Chicago police are gearing  up
for a repeat performance of the Chicago 7 and "Brutalmania."
 
Terrorists have officially  replaced  demonstrators, according to
the  terrorist  bill  recently  passed  by   Congress.    As   an
accompaniment  to  the  terrorist  bill,  "Terrorist Bill" signed
Presidential Executive Order  13010,  the Critical Infrastructure
Protection Order.  This Presidential Order creates a special Task
Force called the Infrastructure Protection Task Force, IPTF.  The
sweeping array of power and information that will be provided  to
the  IPTF  makes  FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Association]
look like the Mouseketeers.
 
               -+- Effective Date August 17 -+-
 
The Presidential Order goes  into  effect August 17, just shortly
after the Republican Convention.   Speculation  exists  that  the
Terrorist  Gestapo  will  be  trotted out just in time to prevent
riots and terrorism in Chicago at the Democratic Convention.
 
As a result of the  expected terrorist threat, the Chicago police
superintendent has seen fit to restore all the old police powers,
powers that some citizens of Chicago say  bordered  on  a  police
state.
 
        -+- The Red Squad Joins The Terrorist Gestapo -+-
 
The infamous Chicago Police intelligence unit, the Red Squad, has
been  reactivated  and  given  an  all-encompassing  directive of
keeping the city  free  from  terrorist  activity.  The Red Squad
bears a striking resemblance, on a local level, to the  Terrorist
Gestapo  created  by  Presidential  Executive Order #13010, which
goes into effect on August  17.  The Democratic Convention begins
August 26.
 
Thanks to the new terrorist bill and the  Presidential  Executive
Order   on   protecting  the  critical  infrastructure,  the  new
handy-dandy terrorist label can  easily  fit almost anyone in any
situation.  Back in 1968, the police were slightly encumbered  by
the  Constitution  and "probable cause."  Under today's terrorist
bill, which was passed in  the  nick  of time to ensure terrorist
cooperation at the convention, the Chicago police no longer  have
to be hamstrung by the "outdated," "antiquated" Constitution.
 
"The  IPTF's  function  is  to  identify  and coordinate existing
expertise, inside and  outside  of  the  Federal Government."  In
Chicago, the  "existing  expertise"  is  the  Red  Squad.   Under
Executive  Order 13010 the IPTF, otherwise known as the Terrorist
Gestapo, is ordered to "provide, or facilitate and coordinate the
provision of, expert  guidance  to  critical infrastructures *to*
*detect*, *prevent*, *halt*, *or* *confine* *an* *attack*..."
 
Chicago is getting ready  to  declare  martial law to protect the
President and other members of the Democratic  party  while  they
are  at the convention.  They will coordinate all activities with
the Terrorist Gestapo.  The IPTF  has  been given the go-ahead to
detect, prevent,  halt  or  confine  an  attack.   All  executive
departments  and agencies have been ordered to cooperate with the
IPTF  and   provide   requested   assistance.   Furthermore,  all
executive departments and agencies have  been  ordered  to  share
information when "requested" by IPTF.
 
In   other  words,  the  Terrorist  Gestapo  has  been  given  an
all-encompassing power by Executive  Order  13010.  Anyone or any
agency or department that refuses a "request" made  by  the  IPTF
can   be   labeled  a  traitor  or  a  terrorist  and  prosecuted
accordingly.
 
This  Terrorist  Gestapo  force  will  parlay  its  power  into a
national police force.  The tap  dance  they  plan  on  doing  in
Chicago with the old Chicago Red Squad will be a trial run to see
how  much  they  can  get  away with in order to call up the next
round of Presidential Executive Orders and Directives.
 
         -+- Even the Sewer Covers Are Welded Shut -+-
 
To prevent terrorist  moles  from  infiltrating  any  part of the
convention, the police have even welded shut all the storm sewers
around the United Center in Chicago, the forum for the Democratic
Convention.
 
                -+- Step Down or Step Aside -+-
 
Does all  the  rapid  activity  in  the  Office  of  Presidential
Executive  Orders have anything to do with the secret White House
meeting which took place Saturday, August 3, 1996?
 
The meeting took place barely  a  day  and a half after President
Clinton raged at a Rose Garden  news  conference.   He  had  been
asked  if he had gone back on his word to pay the legal bills for
fired and then  prosecuted  White  House  Travel Office employee,
Billy Dale.  He bristled in anger and rage and began berating the
CBS correspondent who asked the  question.   As  his  temper  and
voice  rose,  Chief  of  Staff  Leon Panetta was seen frantically
waving to  press  aides  to  end  the  news  conference.   As the
President's staff tried to herd him back into the safety  of  the
Oval Office, the President was heard screaming at the media.
 
Could the reason for this uncharacteristic outburst of temper and
rage have been that the President knew that 10 of the top leaders
of  the  Democratic  party  were planning on ordering him to step
down or step aside,  and  do  it  two  days before the Democratic
Convention begins in Chicago?
 
RMNews sources from the  Chicago  and  Washington  stations  have
reported  that  the  secret  meeting  was  chaired  by former DNC
Chairman and Ambassador to  Russia, Robert Strauss.  Mr. Strauss,
who vehemently denies being at the  meeting,  is  considered  the
ranking elder statesman of the Democratic party.
 
Strauss  and  his  gang  of  10  high-ranking  Democratic leaders
allegedly told Clinton  that  the  gathering storm of indictments
and revelations against  Hillary  would  destroy  the  Democratic
Party.
 
The  President  was  shown  a  photograph of the upcoming federal
criminal indictment which accuses  her of perjury and obstruction
of justice.
 
The President shouted in rage  that  they  were  all  "traitors."
Knowing that Executive Order 13010 had just created the Terrorist
Gestapo,  the  President's  angry use of the word traitor carried
sinister and potentially deadly overtones to the 10 brave men who
are risking their careers and lives to save the Democratic Party.
 
Countering  Clinton's  raging  outburst  with  one  of  his  own,
Ambassador Strauss reportedly smashed  an  ashtray on a desk near
the President and shouted, "You use cocaine and liquor.  You  are
unfit  to  deal  with  worldwide  emergencies."   The   President
screamed back at Strauss with a string of obscenities and curses.
Strauss  fired  back that the President is acting deranged and as
such could be removed by the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
 
Strauss allegedly ordered the President to resign his  office  or
to declare before the Democratic Convention that he does not wish
to  be  nominated  for  a  second  term.  The President has never
officially declared that he is a candidate for the Presidency.
 
Of course, since, as already noted, Strauss  denies  having  been
present  in person at the August 3rd meeting, he presumably would
also deny having smashed  down  an  ashtray,  having engaged in a
shouting match with President Clinton, etc.
 
Prior to the secret meeting, the "Gang of 10," with  the  aid  of
others,  have  secretly  arranged  for  damaging  stories  on the
president and his wife to leak out.
 
One   story  was  already  leaked  by  the  Director  of  Central
Intelligence,  John  Deutch.    The   CIA  Director  ordered  the
Inspector General to investigate claims  that  U.S.  Intelligence
Agencies  were  involved  in  illegal  arms  shipments  and  drug
smuggling  at  an  isolated airstrip in Mena, Arkansas during the
years that  Bill  Clinton  was  Governor.   Susan  Schmidt of the
Washington Post broke the story on  August 7, four days after the
secret White House ultimatum.  [CN:  Late breaking:   Deutch  now
says  he wants to resign as DCIA and return to the Pentagon.  Did
trying to lift the lid on  Mena  expose him to too much hostility
within CIA?  Or perhaps,  as  suggested  by Linda Thompson, it is
"cross pollination" between CIA and the military.]
 
Clinton later sent word to the Gang  of 10 that he did not accede
to their demands.  He was then told that a floor fight would take
place at the Democratic Convention by prominent delegates.  These
delegates would charge him and the first lady with  participating
in  a  string of crimes and accuse them of damaging or destroying
the Democratic Party.
 
                -+- The Secret Trials Begin -+-
 
With the all-encompassing powers  given  to the Terrorist Gestapo
by Presidential Order 13010, "Terrorist Bill" has  the  power  to
"confine an attack."  The attack upon the Office of the President
is coming from loyal Democrats.  Using the power of the Executive
Order  that  he  just  signed, the President now has the power to
label any loyal Democrat a  traitor and a terrorist and "confine"
him in order  to  "halt"  his  upcoming  activities  against  the
President.   The  words  within the quotation marks are the exact
words taken from Executive Order 13010.
 
RMNews has reported that Chicago is run by the Rothschild family.
In that issue, Bill Clinton's illegitimate Rockefeller roots were
detailed.  The  deadly  feud  between  the  Rockefellers  and the
Rothschilds was also described.  Bill  Clinton,  the  politician,
was  created by his maternal grandfather, Winthrop Rockefeller, a
former governor of Arkansas.   He  was  promoted and supported by
the Rockefellers.   But  even  the  Rockefellers  have  seen  the
writing  on  the  wall.   Bill Clinton is a disaster for America.
Four more  years  of  Clinton  and  his  wife  could  destroy the
Rockefeller base in America.
 
It could bring down the illegal Federal Reserve, abolish the  IRS
and  create  full-scale warfare in the streets of America.  While
limited riots and wars are always  good for business, the type of
war that a continued Clinton presidency could bring will  totally
devastate  and  destroy  the  Rockefeller  family, as well as all
other  wealthy  Americans.   In  other  words,  America  would be
leveled and possibly conquered by  an  outside  power.   If  this
outside  power  is backed by the blood enemy of the Rockefellers,
the Rothschilds, there  is  little  doubt  that  any  of the vast
Rockefeller fortune would be spared.  More than likely  it  would
all be nationalized for the benefit of the state.
 
Sensing  the danger to themselves by their illegitimate creation,
the Rockefellers have seen fit to demand that Bill Clinton remove
himself from the office.  If  he  chooses  to fight them, he will
have the support of their enemies, the Rothschilds.   Could  that
be  the  real reason that the Democratic convention is being held
in Chicago this year?  Is the Chicago Red Squad owned outright by
the Rothschilds?  Will the Gang of 10 find themselves "confined,"
i.e., detained for questioning for the duration of the Democratic
Convention?
