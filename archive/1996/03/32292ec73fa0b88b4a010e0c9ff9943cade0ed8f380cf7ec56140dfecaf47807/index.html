Good Privacy, or PGP, solved that problem. He gave the

it possible for an ordinary citizen to have a private

Zimmermann acknowledges that his handiwork might be used for
criminal purposes. But the fuel of his motivation was moral
outrage at a government that may spy on its citizens. By
giving away PGP, the designer felt he could strike a pre-
emptive blow before the government made encryption illegal.
As it turns out, he made his move just in time.


Zimmermann, whether a folk hero or an aider and abettor of
criminals, is a man no one would pick out as a cyberspace
guerrilla.

John Perry Barlow, one of the founders of Electronic Freedom
Foundation, an influential cyberspace civil rights group,
describes him as "an apparently unformidable gnome on a
tight budget (who) now terrifies a security monolith which
required half a century, uncounted billions of dollars and
the collective IQs of a few thousand geniuses to develop."

minds. "We decided to stay and fight," he said.

And fight he did. He began as any techno-wonk would, by
learning everything he could about the issues. Zimmermann
read military strategy and listened to the thinkers in the
opposition. He felt that too often the left refused to know
anything about those who disagree with them

"That makes you weak," he said.

The left was technophobic, as well. It became clear to
Zimmermann that the right had some real firepower. The
republicans had made very good use of computers in the 1984
campaign. To prevail, the newly minted activist realized
that the movement had to use everything in its power. And
that included computers.

"Phil was invaluable to us," said Tchozewski. "Not only as a
speaker, at which he was very good, but because of his
technical knowledge and his remarkable intellectual
capacities. He asked very tough questions. He started a
study group and then he contributed his technical
expertise."

Tchozewski, now running the Boulder-based Global Green
Grants Fund, says that Zimmermann was arrested twice at anti-
nuclear demonstrations, but he thinks Zimmermann has been
more sorely tested in recent years.

Zimmermann did take the risk. He had begun thinking about
encryption after realizing that the government was breaking
into radical organizations.

"</span><span class="n">Mostly</span> <span class="n">they</span> <span class="n">were</span> <span class="n">taking</span> <span class="n">floppy</span> <span class="n">disks</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">membership</span>
<span class="n">information</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">It</span> <span class="n">didn</span><span class="s1">'t take much to know we needed to keep
our communications secret. So I began to read the scholarly
papers on the subject and knew that some of the original
problems of encryption had been solved in the `70'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="n">two</span>
<span class="n">scholars</span> <span class="n">at</span> <span class="n">Stanford</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">began</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">work</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">problems</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"

One of the people Zimmermann contacted for help was Charlie
Merritt, a cryptographer in Arkansas. Merritt and his wife,
Hobbit, had made their own encryption program years earlier.

"</span><span class="n">We</span> <span class="n">were</span> <span class="n">selling</span> <span class="n">encryption</span> <span class="n">software</span> <span class="n">abroad</span><span class="p">--</span> <span class="n">there</span> <span class="n">wasn</span><span class="s1">'t
much use for it in the U.S. then, but a lot of foreign
customers were interested," said Merritt. "The NSA shut us
down. Pretty near ruined us. I'</span><span class="n">d</span> <span class="n">been</span> <span class="n">holding</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">grudge</span> <span class="n">for</span>

For two years, Zimmermann and Merritt talked on the phone.
Eventually Merritt spent a week in Boulder and showed
Zimmermann how to run the enormous series of numbers
necessary to create PGP. They continued to talk on the phone
until the program was nearly completed.

Hobbit Merritt added, "</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">think</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">success</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">PGP</span> <span class="n">is</span>

<span class="n">government</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"

By 1990 Zimmermann had most of the pieces for PGP, but he
hadn't put it together. So he bit the bullet, taking on very
little consulting business and working seven 12-hour days a
week on the encryption program. It took him six months and
he missed five mortgage payments during that time. "</span><span class="n">I</span><span class="s1">'m
pathologically optimistic," he said. "I had no idea it would
take that long."

In the middle of the process the government proposed Senate
Bill 266, which would essentially outlaw all private
encryption. Zimmermann knew then that he was in a  race with
the government. He beat them. In the summer of 1991, PGP was
posted on the Internet. He didn'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">post</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">himself</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">since</span> <span class="s2">"I

frustration of a whole new generation of eavesdropping-proof

<span class="n">Monday</span> <span class="n">morning</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">He</span><span class="s1">'ll be speaking on privacy and seeing
bankers, venture capitalists and other cryptologists.

He'</span><span class="n">d</span> <span class="n">like</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">squeeze</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">Louvre</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">He</span><span class="s1">'s never been to

He'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">taking</span> <span class="n">his</span> <span class="n">wife</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Casey</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">She</span> <span class="n">stood</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="n">him</span> <span class="n">through</span>

<span class="n">held</span><span class="p">.</span>

<span class="n">Zimmermann</span><span class="s1">'s future is finally here, now that the feds have
thrown in the towel and he'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">free</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">his</span> <span class="n">life</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="k">And</span> <span class="n">he</span><span class="s1">'s not missing one nanosecond of his 15 minutes.

There was a party in his honor the previous Saturday night.
He'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">been</span> <span class="n">up</span> <span class="n">since</span> <span class="m">9</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">having</span> <span class="n">his</span> <span class="n">picture</span> <span class="n">taken</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">something</span> <span class="n">he</span><span class="s1">'s done an average of once a week for two years
since his case hit the media. Venture capitalists from
Atlanta, a genial father-and-son duo, flew in for a brief
dinner with him on Sunday night and 20 minutes of his time
Monday morning. They came bearing a gift: a black glove-
leather motorcycle jacket with a Harley Davidson logo. The
gift must have set them back $500. There'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">millions</span> <span class="n">more</span>
<span class="n">dollars</span> <span class="n">where</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">came</span> <span class="k">from</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">they</span><span class="s1">'d like to give some
to Zimmermann to help fund his new business.

The new company is going to make PGP look like small
potatoes, according to Zimmermann. He says he has developed
an encryption program for telephones. This software
application will make phone tapping virtually impossible.

"It'</span><span class="n">ll</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">government</span> <span class="n">going</span> <span class="n">ballistic</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" crows
Zimmermann. The uses are unlimited, especially if it's
inexpensive, impenetrable and easy to use. So far, the test
model has fulfilled all those criteria. The word is out and
entrepreneurs are coming out of the woodwork.

Zimmermann's pace has accelerated. He can hardly answer his
e-mail and admits that every once in a while when the voice
mail is out of hand he just dumps it all and assumes anyone
with something important to say will call back. On his phone
answering tape, he patiently explains that he can't help
everyone who calls him for help with PGP.

He's tired of "</span><span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">guys</span> <span class="n">who</span> <span class="n">think</span> <span class="n">they</span> <span class="n">see</span> <span class="n">black</span>
<span class="n">helicopters</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">had</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">extraordinary</span> <span class="n">conversations</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">people</span> <span class="n">using</span> <span class="n">PGP</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">" He may have to take his `60s vintage
Volkswagen bus to the shop to be fixed. He used to fix it
himself.

Even though his schedule has gone into warp speed,
Zimmermann is finding the time to do a few things for
himself. A little absent-minded, perennially rumpled, with
curly hair and beard, he's decided to throw of the sartorial
schackles and become "</span><span class="n">Phil</span> <span class="n">Zimmermann</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Bad</span> <span class="n">Boy</span>
<span class="n">Cryptologist</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">" He laughs, but he's not kidding. He loves
that motorcycle jacket.

"</span><span class="n">After</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="n">attention</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">tension</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" he says, "</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">just</span>
<span class="n">want</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">things</span> <span class="n">for</span> <span class="n">fun</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">I</span><span class="s1">'ve been wearing a suit and
being careful of what I say and how I appear because of this
investigation. Now it'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">time</span> <span class="n">for</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">other</span> <span class="n">things</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"

Ever since the feds dropped their investigation Jan. 11,
he's been spending time in fancy hotels in Silicon Valley,
listening to CEOs woo him and consulting with the behemoths
of technology.

"</span><span class="n">It</span><span class="s1">'s a lot of fun," he says, a bit incredulous. "Guys who
have run huge companies want to talk to me."

Zimmermann may have become familiar with the toys and
terrain of the Silicon Valley potentates and he may miss the
Louvre if the French bankers demand all his attention, but
Saturday night was like old times.

His wife threw a "Phil Got Off the Hook Party" at the Rocky
Mountain Peace Center, a funky meeting hall for lefties.

It was a gathering of peacenik friends from his nuclear
protest days, family and lawyers. Guys with shoulder-length
hair scarfed potluck casseroles and talked gigabytes. It
ended early. The kids had to get up to bed. Phil cleaned up,
recycling the trash, and carefully bagging the leftovers.

Sidebar: PGP was huge leap forward for cryptography

Historically cryptology has been the realm of spies. It was
the veil drawn over military secrets and diplomatic pouches.
The cracking of the super-secret Nazi code Enigma by the
Allies helped win the Second World War.

With the invention of cyberspace, the need to identify
message senders and to send messages so that others cannot
read them has become a necessity in business and personal
lives. The shift was created by the computer, fax, and phone
communications. It has become increasingly obvious that
almost anyone can listen to or read information from these
sources.

Two-key cryptography, one of the most important advances in
the field and which made PGP possible, was discovered by
Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, professors at Stanford
University. In this system every user has two keys. The
first is a public one, given out to correspondents. The
second is a private one, kept by the individual. Before,
there had been a third party, a key manager, who kept the
keys. In two-key cryptography there is no their party to be
trusted.

After Diffie and Hellman published their findings in 1976,
three MIT mathematicians developed a system to put two-key
cryptography into practice. Their company is called RSA.

Philip Zimmermann came along in the 1980s, took the
information others had developed and created PGP.
