-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------
Legend: RC = Reinforced concrete; C = Concrete without reinforcement
Notes:
(1) All concrete  used in vault  construction will  be monolithic  cast in
place,
Class A,  con-
forming to  US Army Corps of  Engineers Specification C.E.  204 (minimum
compressive strength  of
3000 psi after  28 days of aging). Reinforcing will  be by minimum 5/8-inch
diameter steel  rein-
forcing bars  (rebars) laid  a maximum of  6 inches  on centers, creating  a
cross-hatched  steel
curtain, to  be sandwiched at half  thickness of the concrete,  parallel to the
longest  surface.
Rebars will be anchored or imbedded in all contiguous walls/surfaces.
(2) Class B vault walls will be constructed of masonry at least 8 inches thick,
such  as brick or
concrete block employing adequate bond. Hollow masonry, only of the  vertical
cell
(load bearing)
type, can also be  used, but if used, each cell  will have from ceiling to
floor
1/2-inch diame-
ter or  larger rebar  inserted, and then  be filled with  pea gravel  and
Portland
cement  grout.
Rebars will be  anchored in both floor and  ceiling to a depth of  at least 4
inches. In  seismic
areas, 6-inch or thicker RC will be required.
(3) Class C vault walls will be  constructed of thick-shell concrete block or
vertical  cell clay
tile and be not less than 8 inches thick. In seismic areas,  6-inch or thicker
RC
will be used.
===============================================================================

AR 380-5 H-2. Lightweight alternate Class A vault specifications
Interim lightweight alternate class A and B vault specifications
(for use above ground level only). Where building structural
design factors preclude the use of a standard class A or B  vault
design at above ground level locations, a modular vault-ASTM type
I, U.L. class-M approved under ANSI/UL Standard 608, dated 27 June
1983 or later, may be used. Until final testing of this product  is
completed, it will not be used in lieu of the conventional
designed vaults, at or below grade. Existing steel lined rooms,
built to previously approved specifications, will continue to be
approved for use, but further construction of steel liners will be
deferred in favor of the above specified ANSI/UL Standard 608
product.

AR 380-5 H-3. Doors for both methods of vault construction
The vault will be equipped with an approved vault door of the  type
presently listed on the Federal Supply Schedule. The Class 5 vault
door will be used with reinforced concrete vaults. Where weight of
construction is a factor and a steel-lined vault is used, a Class
6 vault door may be used, if obtainable. Normally, a vault should
have only one entrance. When a vault exceeds 1,000 square feet of
floor space or has more than eight occupants, it should have a
minimum of two exits (one of which will be the entrance) for
safety purposes. When more than one entrance is required, each
must be equipped with the approved door, but only one door will  be
used for normal access. The use of a vault door for controlling
movement into and out of a facility is not authorized as this
continued use will create undue wear on the door and will
eventually weaken the locking mechanism and cause malfunctioning.
Therefore, a vestibule should be constructed at the entrance with
an access door to achieve control when the vault door is open.
Where building codes require that the vault entrance meet a
specified fire rating, the vestibule and its access door must be
of the required fire rating. Where permissible, the vault door
optional day gate may be employed as the entrance control in lieu
of the above vestibule. There will be no windows in a vault,  and
all ventilator openings or other access routes into the vault will
be properly treated to deny unauthorized access. Sound attenuation
will be fully employed and where inadequate, white noise masking
will be added to prevent classified discussions from being
overheard.

AR 380-5 H-4. Additional security safeguards for vaults
All vaults designated Class A or B will have intrusion and fire
protection. In addition, when a vault is unattended, the areas
contiguous to such vault will be supervised either by frequent
routine guard patrols or electronic means so as to increase the
depth of security and to allow early detection of trespass.
Detection of trespass outside the vault is preferred to detection
of vault penetration, since response to the former should preclude
the latter. Detection systems that indicate attempted penetration
(such as vibration sensors) are acceptable, provided they allow
adequate response time before actual barrier violation.

AR 380-5 H-5. Security assistance
If requested in writing, additional technical advice and guidance
relative to vault security problems, may be obtained from the
Commander, Intelligence Materiel Activity (IMA), ATTN: AMXIM-PS,
Fort Meade, MD 20755.


AR 380-5 Section II
Security Upgrading Via Construction-Buildings, Offices, and
Rooms

AR 380-5 H-6. Approved standards for security upgrading
The following guidance is offered as a norm against which-
 a. To  evaluate  the  adequacy  of  existing  structural  security
safeguards.
 b. To provide security guidance for new construction in areas
which will contain activities and material of foreign intelligence
interest.

AR 380-5 H-7. Hardware
Heavy-duty builder's hardware should be used in construction, and
all screws, nuts, bolts, hasps, clamps, bars, 2-inch-square mesh
of No. 11 wire, 18-gauge expanded metal screen, hinges, pins,
etc., should be securely fastened to preclude surreptitious
removal and ensure visual evidence of tampering. Hardware
accessible from outside the area should be peened, pinned, brazed,
or tack-welded to preclude removal. The term ""2-inch-square mesh
of No. 11 wire,'' which meets the requirements of Federal
Specification RR-F-191d, 17 June 1965, hereinafter shall be
referred to as ""wire mesh.''

AR 380-5 H-8. Interior walls
Construction should be plaster, gypsum wallboard, metal panels,
hardboard, wood, plywood, or other opaque materials offering
similar resistance to, and evidence of, unauthorized entry into
the area. If insert-type panels are used, a method should be
devised to prevent the removal of such panels without leaving
visual evidence of tampering. Area barriers up to a height of 8
feet should be of opaque or translucent construction where visual
access is a factor. If visual access is not a factor, the  area
barrier walls may be of wire mesh or other nonopaque material
offering similar resistance to, and evidence of, unauthorized
entry into the area.

AR 380-5 H-9. Windows
Window openings 18 feet or less from an access point (for example,
another window outside the area, roof, ledge, door, and so forth)
should be fitted with 1/2-inch bars (separated by no more than 6
inches), plus crossbars to prevent spreading, or 18-gauge expanded
metal screen, or wire mesh securely fastened on the inside. When
visual access is a factor, the windows should be kept closed and
locked at all times, and also should be made translucent or opaque
by any practical method such as painting or covering the inside of
the glass. During nonduty hours the windows should be closed and
securely fastened to preclude surreptitious removal of classified
material.


AR 380-5 H-10. Doors
Doors should be substantially constructed of wood or metal. When
windows, panels, or similar openings are used in the door, they
should be secured with 18-gauge expanded metal screen or wire mesh
securely fastened on the inside. If visual access is a factor, the
windows should be translucent or opaqued. When doors are used in
pairs, a mullion insert anchored top and bottom should be
installed between the doors.

AR 380-5 H-11. Door louvers or baffle plates
When used, they should be reinforced with 18-gauge expanded metal
screen, or wire mesh fastened inside the area.

AR 380-5 H-12. Door locking devices
 a. Entrance  doors should be  secured with  either a  GSA-approved
built-in, three-position,  dial-type, changeable combination  lock;
a  GSA-approved  combination  padlock  (per  paragraph   5-101)  as
amended  and  as  specified in  paragraph  5-102d;  a  key-operated
padlock  or locking  device with  high security  cylinder and  hasp
(see figure H-1) as described in the same paragraph;  or a built-in
1-inch throw,  deadbolt lock equipped  with the GSA-approved  high-
security  cylinder; or  preferably a  combination  of these.  Other
doors should be  firmly secured from the  inside with a panic  bolt
(actuated by a  panic bar), a deadbolt,  a rigid wood or metal  bar
(fitted to preclude  ""springing''), extending across the width  of
the door and  held in position by  solid clamps, preferably on  the
door  casing,  or  other means  approved  by  the  cognizant  OPSEC
Support Unit and Fire Marshal.
 b. The new High-Security Padlock approved July 1982 became
available within the supply system late fall 1982. It has the same
Federal Stock Number as the Sargent and Greenleaf (S&amp;G) Model 831B
Padlock, which is being phased out of service.

AR 380-5 H-13. Ceilings
Ceilings should be constructed of plaster, gypsum wallboard
material, panels, hardboard, wood, plywood, ceiling tile, or other
material offering similar resistance to and detection of
unauthorized entry. Wire mesh, 18-gauge expanded metal screen, or
other nonopaque material offering similar resistance to, and
evidence of, unauthorized entry into the area may be used if
visual access to classified material is not a factor. When wall
barriers do not extend to the ceiling, and a false ceiling is
used, this false ceiling should be reinforced with wire mesh or
18-gauge expanded metal screen, alarmed and otherwise secured with
heavy-duty builder's hardware. (This measure also applies when
panels are removable, and entry can be gained into the area
without visible detection.) When wire mesh or expanded metal
screens are used, they must be secured to adjoining walls in a
manner which precludes removal without leaving evidence of
tampering. In those instances where barrier walls of an area
extend to a solid ceiling, there is no need to reinforce a  false
ceiling; however, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) should
monitor this otherwise unobserved area.

AR 380-5 H-14. Ceilings (unusual cases)
It is recognized that instances may arise where activities have a
valid justification for not erecting a solid suspended ceiling as
part of the area, especially in high-ceiling hangars. The activity
may contend that the use of a suspended ceiling is impractical
because of production methods, such as the use of overhead cranes
for moving bulky equipment within the area. Cases also exist where
the air conditioning system may be impeded by the construction of
a solid suspended ceiling (such as ADP centers). At times, even
the height of the classified material may make a suspended ceiling
impractical. In such cases, special provisions should be made to
ensure that surreptitious entry cannot be achieved by entering the
area over the top of the barrier walls (for example, employ
approved intrusion detection systems, sensors, and more frequent
guard patrols). Areas of this type should be closely scrutinized
to ensure that the structural safeguards are adequate to preclude
entry via adjacent pipes, catwalks, and ladders, or to preclude
observation, if visual access is a factor.

AR 380-5 H-15. Miscellaneous openings
Where ducts, pipes, registers, sewers, and tunnels are of such
size and shape as to permit unauthorized entry (in excess of 96
square inches, for example), they will be secured by 18-gauge
expanded metal screen, wire mesh, or where more practical steel
bars at least 1/2-inch in diameter with a maximum space of 6
inches between the bars. The steel bars will be securely fastened
at both ends to preclude removal, and will have 1/4-inch thick by
1-1/2-inch wide steel crossbars at 18-inch intervals to prevent
spreading. When wire mesh, expanded metal screen, or steel bars
are used, installation should ensure that classified material
cannot be removed through the openings with the aid of any type  of
instrument. Care also will be taken to ensure that a barrier
placed across any waterway (sewer or tunnel) will not cause
clogging or offer obstruction to the free flow of water or sewage.

AR 380-5 H-16. Approved alarm systems
Information and limitation  on use of approved intrusion  detection
systems, both  commercial and DOD J-SIIDS  equipment, can be  found
in  DIA  Manual  50-3,  chapter  III,  dated  2   May  1980.  Model
designations of items  specifically approved for use in  protection
of U.S.  classified information and material  are provided in  that
chapter,  along  with other  pertinent  information.  All  detailed
information relative to  an alarmed area and the electronic  system
protecting its  classified defense  information or materiel  (i.e.,
electrical  diagrams  indicating  wire  runs,  sensor  and  control
placements, as  well as sensor  types and  area of coverage,  floor
plans, and photographs revealing the position or  existence of such
items within the  area), will be tightly controlled and  marked For
Official Use Only.
