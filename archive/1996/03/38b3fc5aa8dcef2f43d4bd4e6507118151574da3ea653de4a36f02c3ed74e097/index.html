                      CALL FOR PAPERS

           INTERNET PRIVACY AND SECURITY WORKSHOP
                   Haystack Observatory, MA
                      May 20-21, 1996

              Privacy and Security Working Group
                   Federal Networking Council

            Research Program on Communications Policy
    Center for Technology, Policy, and Industrial Development
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology


INVITATION

The Privacy and Security Working Group (PSWG) of the Federal  
Networking Council (FNC) and the Research Program on Communications  
Policy of the Center for Technology, Policy, and Industrial 
Development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will 
hold an invitational workshop at the Haystack Observatory outside 
of Boston, MA, on May 20-21, 1996. This workshop is intended to bring
Federal, academic and private sector participants together in
collaboration to develop strategies and potential solutions related 
to Internet privacy and security.

Though a principal focus of the workshop will be on the Federal  
portion of the Internet, the FNC recognizes that the Federal  
Internet is tightly coupled with the Global Internet, whose security  
policies, practices, and goals are complementary to those of the  
Federal Government. To define those practices, procedures and goals,  
the PSWG has undertaken two major initiatives:

- The Federal Internet Security Plan (FISP), which was  
  developed as a scalable, continual improvement process, based on  
  common principles and mechanisms compatible with Internet community  
  values and needs; and

- The Collaborations in Internet Security (CIS) project, an  
  effort aimed at testing the strength of agency approaches to  
  security and moving these technologies beyond individual agency  
  networking environments and into both inter-agency and  
  agency-commercial sector communications. The CIS will result in the  
  development of a new and sustainable process for developing,  
  integrating, and deploying security technologies that are  
  interoperable at all levels of the Federal government and within the  
  commercial and academic sectors.

These initiatives are intended to highlight the critical interface  
between Federal and commercial users and developers of Internet  
services and technologies.

OBJECTIVES

This workshop will bring together principal players in the Federal  
and overall Internet community to discuss the problems and  
challenges of privacy and security on the Internet, and will:

- Identify critical issues, requirements, and recommendations  
  related to future Internet privacy and security research and  
  development efforts;

- Describe "best practice" approaches to Internet privacy and  
  security;

- Develop specific strategies for implementing Internet  
  Security programs involving all sectors of the Internet community;

- Extend the Federal Internet Security Plan (FISP) by  
  defining specific implementations; and finally,

- Develop specific strategies for the migration of  
  technologies from the individual RFC unit test stage to the  
  integration of a complete functional managed system in the CIS  
  test/demonstration/pilot projects.


SUBMISSIONS

Abstracts or complete paper drafts related to the topics listed  
above are welcome.  Accepted papers will be a part of the published  
record of the workshop.  All points of view on Federal policies  
affecting Internet privacy and security are welcome. Please make  
all electronic submissions in ASCII format.

BACKGROUND

Federal Internet Security Plan: In September 1995, the PSWG  
published the draft Federal Internet Security Plan (FISP).  The FISP  
is oriented toward a scalable, continual improvement process, based  
on common principles and mechanisms compatible with Internet  
community values and needs.  See &lt;http://www.fnc.gov/SWG.html&gt;.  The  
plan addresses Internet security requirements, including  
interoperability, from the perspective of the goals and objectives  
outlined in the National Performance Review (NPR),   
http://www.npr.gov/.  The Federal Networking Council developed  
this framework in conjunction with its Advisory Committee which  
represents industry, academia, and non-profit sectors.

Action Items, from the FISP, to be addressed during the Workshop:

Internet Security Policy and Policy Support Activities

* Establish overall Internet security policies
* Address security in all Federally supported NII pilots
* Coordinate Internet community involvement
* Establish an ongoing Internet threat database and assessment 
  capability
* Identify legal and law enforcement issues

Internet Security and Technology Development

* Develop an Internet security maturity model
* Develop Internet security architecture
* Enhance Internet security services and protocols
* Develop a "Secure-Out-of-the-Box" endorsement
* Enhance application security

Internet Security Infrastructure

* Establish a set of Internet security interoperability testbeds
* Support privacy, authentication, certificate, and security  
  services pilots
* Establish Internet security testing and evaluation capabilities
* Improve security incident handling capabilities
* Develop security self-assessment capabilities
* Establish effective secure software and document distribution  
  mechanisms

Education and Awareness

* Compile Internet user and site profiles
* Encourage use of available security technologies
* Establish an Internet security information server
* Establish an Internet security symposium/workshop series
* Establish an Internet security fellowship program

Collaborations in Internet Security: With the Federal government's  
ever-increasing dependency on computers and distributed systems,  
there is great urgency for it to develop and employ enhanced  
information system security technologies and practices. At the same  
time, these Federal technologies must interoperate with those of the  
broader Internet community (encompassing the private and academic  
sectors, along with the Federal sector).

In recognition of these needs, the Federal Networking Council's  
Privacy &amp; Security Working Group (FNC/PSWG) has been awarded a  
National Performance Review (NPR) Innovation Fund grant to compare  
and validate agency approaches to security. This Collaborations in  
Internet Security (CIS) project aims to test the strength of these  
technologies beyond individual agency networking environments,  
emphasizing the inter-agency and agency-commercial sector  
communications. The CIS will result in the development of a new and  
sustainable process for developing, integrating, and deploying  
security technology that is interoperable at all levels of the  
Federal Government and within the commercial and academic sectors.

The governing principles behind the Security Testbeds include:  
employment of an open process (with the activities and results open  
to participation and comment by both public and private sector  
participants); a focus on multivendor technologies; an emphasis on  
testing and experimentally deploying security technologies emerging  
from research and private sectors as well as security technologies  
currently in use in the commercial environment; and an underlying  
objective to ensure interoperability among the broad Internet  
community (federal, private, and academic). Initial tests will  
include demonstrations of Kerberos v.5, testing of single-use  
passwords, and digital signatures. For more information, please see
