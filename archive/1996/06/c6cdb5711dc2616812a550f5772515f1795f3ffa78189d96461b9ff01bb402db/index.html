&gt;This is off-topic for the list, but I want to share it anyway. It touches
&gt;on issues of increasing police surveillance, and also touches on the issue
&gt;of "age credentials" (in the sense that how else is a cop who stops a young
&gt;person for "curfew violation" to determine if a violation has occurred when
&gt;most 14- and 15-year-olds carry no driver's licenses?)
&gt;
&gt;The "curfew" meme is spreading quickly, with Clinton calling for a federal
&gt;curfew, at least in cities, and Dole trying to outdo him with even more
&gt;draconian curfew laws. Many communities already have them, including San
&gt;Jose, New Orleans, and other large cities. And my own community, Santa Cruz
&gt;County, ironically begins a curfew program on Saturday, tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt;I wrote this item for our local newsgroup, scruz.general, announcing that
&gt;"my household" will not abide by this law. I didn't come out and say "my
&gt;kids" would not abide by it, inasmuch as I have no kids. So I elliptically
&gt;referred to "parents and guardians"...after all, my sister visits with her
&gt;husband and son, and in theory I could be the guardian of this kid. And
&gt;friends bring their kids.
&gt;
&gt;My point is to send a "warning" to the Sheriff's office that at least some
&gt;households think this crackdown on the movements of children is
&gt;unacceptable. Children have the right to travel, especially as the parents
&gt;permit it, without being stopped, questioned, forced to state their
&gt;destinations, and, if the answers don't satisfy the cop, taken into
&gt;detention at some children's equivalent of a "drunk tank."
&gt;
&gt;(Some purists claim that children are exempted from normal constitutional
&gt;protections, such as the right of free association, the right to be free
&gt;from unwarranted searches and seizures, the right of free speech, etc.
&gt;Especially this comes up in debates about rights in public schools (speech,
&gt;locker searches, movements are controlled, etc.). But I think a public
&gt;school environment is a dramatically different situation, whatever one
&gt;thinks of these claims about rights, from a kid walking on a public street.
&gt;To claim that such a child may be stopped, interrogated, taken to a
&gt;detention center, without a crime having been committed, is a clear
&gt;violation of his or her rights.)
&gt;
&gt;As I said, should such curfews become widespread, children will of course
&gt;need forms of age identification, and this opens yet another door for
&gt;universal I.D. cards. And for "travel papers."
&gt;
&gt;Maybe it would be easier to just put a tattoo on their arms--especially as
&gt;the younger generation is so into tattoos these days. "Pappieren, bitte.
&gt;Macht schnell!"
&gt;
&gt;Here's what I sent in to scruz.general tonight:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So Santa Cruz begins its own fascist crackdown on the free movements of
&gt;persons. The "curfew" begins Saturday night.
&gt;
&gt;Allegedly these persons are children, but it is up to parents and
&gt;guardians to control the movements of their children or charges in public
&gt;places, NOT the function of the police to detain these children or
&gt;charges. (Initially a "warning," but the child's name is recorded in
&gt;police data bases....if the child is detained a second time, he or she may
&gt;face detention time, community service, fines on the parents or guardians,
&gt;and so forth.)
&gt;
&gt;ANNOUNCEMENT: I am responsible for the children in my household or in my
&gt;custody or guardianship. Not the cops. Not the Sheriff. Not the CAMP
&gt;helicopters. Not the narcs. Not the vice squad. Not anyone but me.
&gt;
&gt;I am instructing those in my household or who visit to IGNORE all
&gt;interrogations by cops. I am telling them not to let the cops search their
&gt;bags, not to let the cops ask where they are going, not to let the cops
&gt;demand that they give a reason for being out. If they pick up people from
&gt;my household, I expect the children to remain silent and to just fill up
&gt;the god-damned jail cells until I eventually raise a ruckus and (maybe)
&gt;pick them up.
&gt;
&gt;If some kids are out and about and making mischief, the cops should
&gt;concentrate on catching _those_ children! Don't immobilize all kids  for
&gt;the sake of supposedly cutting down on the activities of the perps. As
&gt;with so many do-gooder laws, the effect will largely be felt on the "good"
&gt;kids and will be ignored or evaded by the "bad" kids.
&gt;
&gt;As to the claims that children have no valid reason to be out after 9, or
&gt;11, or whatever, this is not for anyone but the parents and guardians to
&gt;decide. The god-damned cops are not the ones to decide what a valid reason
&gt;for being out is.
&gt;
&gt;(I have heard that "religious worship," a la "Midnight Mass," is one of
&gt;the valid reasons for a child to be out after curfew. Fine, religion is
&gt;then the stated reason those in my household are out! I will tell them to
&gt;tell any nosy cops or Sheriff's Deputies that they are worshippers of
&gt;Baal, and Baal requires them to be out to appreciate the darkness. If the
&gt;cops claim this is "not a valid religion," I will recite to them the First
&gt;Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, where it says: "Congress shall make no
&gt;law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
&gt;exercise thereof.")
&gt;
&gt;I moved to the rural part of Santa Cruz, Corralitos, to escape this
&gt;fascist and socialist nonsense, and now I find it primarily the
&gt;Sheriff-dominated parts of this county which will now claim to tell
&gt;parents and guardians they no longer control their children.
&gt;
&gt;Fuck this.

Timothy, 

For the first time in my life I agree with you. I am 13 and the cop here a
assholes. I have been caught about 13 times, yelled at me called my parents
who could give a rat's ass. I feel spend tax payer's money on more cops to
catch the bastard who kill people, not on the kids who just like to take a
walk with my girlfriend. Or when I'm going to the corner store to buy a
6-pack. A 6-pack of coke. Well as the old saying goes, fuck this and
everything that has to do with it!!!!!!!!
