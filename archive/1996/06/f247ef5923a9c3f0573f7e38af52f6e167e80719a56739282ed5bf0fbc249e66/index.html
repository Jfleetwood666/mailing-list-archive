&gt; PR firm declares war on 'rogue' Web sites
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; SAN FRANCISCO (Jun 10, 1996 10:23 a.m. EDT) -- To advertisers and
&gt; activists, the Internet is
&gt; nirvana -- unlimited space and the chance to get their message to the
&gt; world. To the public relations
&gt; firm of Middleberg and Associates, it's a potential nightmare.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the World Wide Web, people unhappy with individual companies
&gt; were reduced to
&gt; convincing a news organization they had a legitimate gripe or standing
&gt; around handing out leaflets at
&gt; corporate headquarters.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, all it takes is a weekend coding some HTML files and every
&gt; complaint or concern they've
&gt; ever had is instantly available to millions.
&gt; 
&gt; "There was the 'Kmart Sucks' site, created by a disgruntled employee
&gt; who was saying a lot of mean
&gt; and nasty things about Kmart. Then there was the First Boston site,
&gt; where a former employee
&gt; published proprietary salary figures," said Don Middleberg, whose firm
&gt; protects its clients from
&gt; attacks on the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; "Companies spend small fortunes to create a brand image and something
&gt; called good will," he said.
&gt; "These sites are actively destroying them."
&gt; 
&gt; To counter the threat, Middleberg's firm monitors the Web for what he
&gt; calls "rogue" sites, then finds
&gt; the people who created them and attempts to convince them to go
&gt; off-line.
&gt; 
&gt; "If gentle persuasion doesn't work," he said from his New York office,
&gt; "you need to bring in the
&gt; lawyers."
&gt; 
&gt; Over and above First Amendment concerns, threats of legal action are a
&gt; long way from the golden
&gt; vision of the Web as an democratic leveler rhapsodized about by Howard
&gt; Rheingold, who has
&gt; written several books about the ethos of the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; "The Internet puts the masses back in mass media. It lets anyone
&gt; publish their manifesto for all the
&gt; world to read," Rheingold said from his home near San Francisco.
&gt; 
&gt; Those days are over, countered Middleberg.
&gt; 
&gt; "Rheingold's perceptions of where things are might have been true a
&gt; few months ago," he said. "But
&gt; this is big business. Things have changed. This is no longer a cottage
&gt; industry. Companies have spent
&gt; millions of dollars on this. They're going to fight to protect their
&gt; sites."
&gt; 
&gt; "If the lawyers decide to go after someone and a company is willing to
&gt; spend the dollars, they
&gt; certainly can threaten and make life very difficult for people."
&gt; 
&gt; It's legally unclear, however, how much power companies actually have.
&gt; Merely making derogatory
&gt; comments is not illegal, said David Maher, co-chair of the
&gt; subcommittee on Internet Trademark
&gt; Issues of the International Trademark Association.
&gt; 
&gt; "If you have an individual who doesn't like Ford motor cars or Burger
&gt; King and says rude things
&gt; about them, the First Amendment provides quite a shield. Just because
&gt; people are saying bad things
&gt; about you, you can't necessarily stop them," he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Not only is truth a defense against libel, but trade libel law
&gt; requires that a company must show it
&gt; actually has been damaged, a higher standard than individuals, who
&gt; must show only that their
&gt; reputations have been damaged, Maher said.
&gt; 
&gt; But legal or not, even the threat might be enough to shut down smaller
&gt; sites, said Jonathan Hall, a
&gt; spokesman for the environmental group Greenpeace -- which maintains an
&gt; active Web site.
&gt; 
&gt; "I wouldn't be surprised if people gave in if they got a call and were
&gt; told to 'remove this or there will
&gt; be legal action.' They might do it because they don't know their legal
&gt; rights," he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Greenpeace does, which is probably why the association of nuclear
&gt; energy producers Middleberg
&gt; recently spoke to considers it such a threat.
&gt; 
&gt; "They are scared to death of groups like Greenpeace, who are very
&gt; clever in how they use the Net
&gt; to get a message out," Middleberg said.
&gt; 
&gt; Not unexpectedly, Middleberg won't name his clients, though he says
&gt; he's added eight to the list in
&gt; the last six months.
&gt; 
&gt; Other public relations firms say they haven't heard of anyone using a
&gt; similar strategy. Curtis Kundred
&gt; of Fleishman Hillard International Communications deemed it a
&gt; short-run approach that will backfire
&gt; in the end.
&gt; 
&gt; "I would hope it's not the job of a public relations firm to muscle
&gt; someone into backing down from
&gt; expressing their beliefs online," added Amy Oringel of InterActive
&gt; Public Relations Inc.
&gt; 
&gt; Up until now, the Web has provided a level playing field, a place
&gt; where "Joe Schmoe can have just
&gt; as much credibility as CNN," said writer Martin A. Lee, whose book
&gt; "Unreliable Sources" was an
&gt; expose of the public relations industry.
&gt; 
&gt; "Money is the great unleveler in this equation," he said. "We seem to
&gt; be in the crux of a shift, when
&gt; the whole equilibrium is shifting from 'a thousand flowers blooming'
&gt; to a corporate market. It's
&gt; disturbing."
