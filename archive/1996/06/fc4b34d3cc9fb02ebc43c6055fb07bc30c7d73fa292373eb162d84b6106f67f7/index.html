---------- Forwarded message ----------

Recently, you requested from our email autoresponder a copy of
The Agincourt Project.  You were not alone.  That document has
made its way around the world.  Law enforcement agencies, public
officials, prosecutors, ISP's and concerned citizens have all been
reading it.

And it has made a difference.  Illegal obscenity and child pornography
IS being removed from the Internet.

And now that the first round of the CDA legal battle is over, and
the focus in the battle against Internet pornography will change
back to the enforcement of local obscenity and child pornography laws.

But the issues are complex, and a single document is just not enough
to keep the public informed.  And so we have started Level30.

Since you had an interest in The Agincourt Project (whatever your
position on it), we thought you'd be interested in Level30.

To receive this biweekly (or more frequently) newsletter, simply send
an e-mail message

     To:  majordomo@databack.com
     Subject:  (leave blank)
     Message:  subscribe level30

About the Purpose - To instruct families on how to safely use the
Internet, and to inform families, law enforcement, the media and
other interested Internet organizations about breaking news in the
fight to keep illegal pornography and child pornography OFF the Internet.

About the Title - This is the Offense Level mandated by the United States
Sentencing Commission for the trafficking of child pornography often
found on the Internet in Usenet newsgroups.  (Base offense level - 17;
if the material involves a prepubescent minor, increase by 2 levels; if
the offense involves distribution, increase by at least 5 levels; if the
offense involves material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct
or other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels; and if a computer
was used to transport or ship the visual depiction, increase by 2 levels.)
(The Sentencing Table can be found at http://www.ussc.gov.)
