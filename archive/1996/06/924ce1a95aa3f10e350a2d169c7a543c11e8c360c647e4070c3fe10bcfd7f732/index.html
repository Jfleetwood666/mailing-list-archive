Gee, those poor CoS posters you mention must be pretty busy to generate
that many messages (which were then canceled).

Homer adjusted Lazarus, and the last I knew the reports didn't have enough
info for anyone to tell who the sender of the cancel was.  Here's an
example from back on the 5th:

Mon Jun  3 19:45:33 EDT 1996  Lazarus V2.3
lightlink.com/var/spool/news/control/1501139
Article: 176082
From: info@ars.com (ARS FAQ)
Date: 1 Jun 1996 17:34:29 GMT
Subject: Bryan Wilson - Diversity Among Religions: A Modern Example.
    Message-ID: &lt;4opuv5$6s0@mordred.cc.jyu.fi&gt;
Control: cancel &lt;4opuv5$6s0@mordred.cc.jyu.fi&gt;
- - ----------------------------------------------------------

Homer condensed them to one post, as they were just exacerbating the spam
clutter.  I wish he'd have left more info in them.

To be honest, I haven't paid that much attention to them in the last few
days, since it's impossible to tell from them who issued the cancel.

If you know who is forging cancels you might want to share with me, but I
honestly don't.  The only people I am aware of who have been canceling have
been JEM and some of the ISPs involved.  Vague accusations against
"Anti-Scientologists" don't really tell me much.

&gt;&gt; really doubt anyone would have checked with Dimitri first, though :)
&gt;
&gt;The forged cancels started a short time after one prominent anti-scentologist
&gt;flamer e-mailed me and asked for a copy of my cancelbot. (The first time I've
&gt;seen him being quasi-polite! :-) The cancels look like they came from my 'bot,
&gt;and are directed at _anything posted by certain Co$ supporters.

I haven't seen any of the actual cancels, and I wouldn't know how to identify
them as being from your bot.

Those "certain Co$ supporters" are all probably one person who's telnetting
to open NNTP ports and forging thousands of messages a day.  The posts are
all obviously produced by a script (pulling info mainly from the CoS book
_What is Scientology_), and they are not anything even in the neighborhood
of an honest attempt at communication.  It's Net abuse, and I think you
must be trolling if you don't see that.

Should have known you'd go where the action is :)

&gt;I don't care about the bizarre religion views of the present or former cult
&gt;members, but forging cancels makes you as much of a slime as Co$.

The messages that are being canceled are forgeries.  They are a result
of an abuse of service.  That isn't at all the same as CoS canceling due
to content.  Those poor "certain Scientologists" you mentioned have produced
over 12,000 forged messages, which are actually only a small number of
articles that are being continually reposted.  Most must be way over the BI.
I'm not crying a river for them.

&gt;I note that you chose to ignore the cypherpunks-relevant portion of my question
&gt;- that the anti-scientologists have been abusing the cypherpunks remailers.

Wow.  Good thing that there was a relevant portion, huh.  :)  Sorry I missed
it.

I have some mixed feelings about the CoS materials that were posted through
the remailers.  I'm sorry that Hacktic was shut down, but I don't think that
was the intent of the people who posted those materials.  They were blowing
the whistle on a criminal organization.  I can't honestly say whether I think
their actions were "right" or not.  

In any case, the actions you've described were committed by a handful of people.
There are hundreds of Anti-Scientologists who post to a.r.s., and many more who
lurk.  Probably less than 5 have done wholesale posting of copyrighted
materials,
(beyond what would be considered "fair use") and most of them didn't even use
remailers.  Scamizdat being the big exception.

I'm assuming that your anti-"Anti-Scientologist" screed is just an attempt to
get people riled up.  Having fun?
