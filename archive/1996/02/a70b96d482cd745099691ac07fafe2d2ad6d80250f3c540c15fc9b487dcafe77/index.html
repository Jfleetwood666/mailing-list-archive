I just posted the following message to a few usenet groups.  I thought
it might be of interest here too.  Note: I know nothing about 
cryptography, and I didn't have to know anything about cryptography
in order to break this pitiful Microsoft 'code'.

David Ross

Here's the message I posted:

I recently was fiddling around with my Windows 95 registry and decided to
see just how "encrypted" passwords for shared items _really_ are.  Well,
after some experimentation, I was able to break the code!  This was
rather surprising to me, considering I'm just a college student with
absolutely no background in encryption.  I have submitted my findings to
"Hack Microsoft" contest.  =)

The implications of this discovery are not extremely apparent.  It would
seem that anyone with access to your registry would already have access
to anything else on your computer.  Nevertheless, the flawed belief that
an encrypted password stored in your registry is actually encrypted to a
degree expected from a company such as Microsoft could lead to potential
security holes.  At least the fact that Microsoft _attempted_ to 
encrypt these passwords might indicate that they saw some reason
themselves to have them inaccessable.

The included C code (with a description of the Microsoft 'encryption'
included) will decode a password for a shared item from its byte code
in the registry.

Here's the program:

/* This program takes an 'encrypted' Windows 95 share password and decrypts it.
 * Look at:
 * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Network\LanMan
 * to find a machine's shares.  Within the data for each share are two
 * registry entries, Parm1enc and Parm2enc.  Parm1enc is the "Full access"
 * password.  Parm2enc is the "Read only" password.

 * Do not distribute this program for any commercial purpose without first
 * contacting me for permission.
 *
 * DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM FOR ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL PURPOSES!
 *
 * A technical description of the 'code' can be found later on in this
 * document. 
 *
 * Oh yeah...  a totally unsolicited self promotion here...  If anyone has
 * a job for a junior year Computer Science student for summer '96, please
 * let me know!  I'm familiar with Windows and Mac networking (especially 
 * involving TCP/IP), fluent in C and C++, and working on becoming a

/*
 * I will document this function, but not the seven other functions
 * which decode the subsequent seven characters.  All of these functions
 * are essentially the same.  Multiple functions are necessary though
 * because each column of the password has a different set of encoding
 * patterns.
 *
 * The following section will attempt to explain the encoding scheme
 * for share passwords as stored in the Windows 95 registry.  I will
 * try to explain this as clearly as I can, however I really have no
 * background in encryption.  If you have any questions, please feel
 * free to send them to me at snakey@cs.umd.edu.
 *
 * First off, share passwords can be anywhere from one character to
 * eight.  "Read only" passwords and "Full access" passwords both use
 * the same encoding scheme, and so they both can be decoded by this
 * program.  There is a one-to-one relationship between the number of
 * characters in a password and the number of bytes in the encoded
 * password stored in the registry.  In fact, each encoded byte directly
 * corresponds to the letter in the corresponding column of the
 * unencoded password!  Ie: If I change a password "passwd" to "masswd",
 * only the first byte of the encrypted password will change.  Knowing
 * this, it is easy to see that all that needs to be done to decode
 * the password is to find a mapping from an encoded byte to a decoded
 * letter.  That's what this program does.  Unfortunately, things get
 * a little tricky because a letter in the first column of a password
 * is encoded using a slightly different algorithm than a letter
 * in the second column, and so on.
 *
 * There is another complexity which we do not really need to worry
 * about to a great extent, but we still need to be aware of.  Many
 * characters, when entered into a password, map to the same encoded
 * byte.  The best example of this is that both 'A' and 'a' are the
 * same as far as share passwords are concerned.  There are numerous
 * other examples of this, and this allows us to effectively limit the
 * range of characters we need to be able to decode.  The range of
 * ASCII values we will have to be able to decode turns out to be
 * from 32 to 159.  ASCII values higher than 159 tend to map to
 * encoded bytes which also represent more normal ASCII values.  So
 * if a user manages to create a password with high ASCII values
 * in it, that password will still be decoded by this program.
 * Although the decoded password won't look the same as the original,
 * it will work just as well.
 *
 * With all of the preliminaries out of the way, I can now move on
 * to describing the mapping from an encoded byte to it's corresponding
 * ASCII value.  I think the best way to describe this would be through
 * a picture of exactly how the characters from 32 to 63 are mapped
 * out in the code for the first letter in a password.  This table goes
 * beyond the 80 column format maintained in the rest of this document,
 * but it is really the best solution.  If the table below doesn't look
 * right, load this file up in a text editor that supports greater than
 * 80 columns.
 *
 *   Encoded byte (hex)    - 1F 1E 1D 1C 1B 1A 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 14 11 10 0F OE 0D 0C 0B 0A 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
 *   ASCII value (decimal) - 42 43 40 41 46 47 44 45 34 35 32 33 38 39 36 37 58 59 56 57 62 63 60 61 50 51 48 49 54 55 52 53
 *   Pair #                - |_6_| |_5_| |_8_| |_7_| |_2_| |_1_| |_4_| |_3_| |14_| |13_| |16_| |15_| |10_| |_9_| |12_| |11_|
 *   Quad #                - |__________2__________| |__________1__________| |__________3__________| |__________4__________|
 *   32 byte block #       - |______________________________________________1______________________________________________|
 *
 * The "Pair #", "Quad #", and "32 byte block #" rows each are there to
 * make the general ordering of the code more visible.  The first thing to
 * note is that the range of encoded byte values runs from 00 to 1f.  This
 * will not always be the case for the first set of 32 characters.  In
 * fact, the next set of 32 characters (ASCII 64 to ASCII 95) is not in
 * the range of 20 to 3f in encoded form.  I never concerned myself with
 * predicting exactly where each of the four 32 byte ranges are aligned
 * within the range of 0 to 256.  In my decoding scheme, I simply specify
 * the location of the first character in a 32 byte block (which I have
 * pre-determined via experimentation) and determine the locations of the
 * rest of the characters in the block relative to the inital value.  This
 * amounts to a total of four hand-decoded characters for the entire code.
 *
 * From a starting point which is given (in this case the fact that ASCII
 * 32 is encoded as 0x15), my decoding scheme follows a pattern that is
 * probably already apparent to you if you have examined the above table
 * closely.  First, if the encoded byte number is odd, it simple subtracts
 * one from this byte number to get the byte number of the encoded form of
 * the subsequent character.  This is much more simple than it sounds.
 * As an example, given that the code for ASCII 32 is 0x15, the program
 * knows that the code for ASCII 33 must be 0x14.  The tricky part is that
 * this is not always true for every code.  Recall that there is a different
 * coding scheme for each of the 8 columns in a password, and that the above
 * table only describes the coding scheme for the first column.  Other columns
 * reverse this relationship between the two ASCII values of a certain pair.
 *
 * Pairs are grouped into units of four, appearing in a predefined pattern.
 * In this case, the first pair (by first I mean the pair with the lowest
 * set of ASCII values) is put in the second slot of a quad (which contains
 * four pairs).  The second pair is put in the first slot, the third is put
 * in the fourth quad, and the fourth is put in the third quad.  This changes
 * depending on the specific code used (of the 8 possible).
 *
 * Quads also fill a block in the same manner, however the ordering is NOT
 * necessarily the same as the way pairs fit into quads!  As I described
 * above, there are four blocks, and they fit into the entire range of
 * 128 values just as pairs fit into quads and quads fit into blocks,
 * via a pattern determined by whoever invented this encoding scheme.  It
 * is important to realize that the range of 128 possible encoded
 * values can be anywhere within the range of 0 to 256.  Ie: One block can
 * be positioned from 0x00 to 0x1f, while another block in the same code
 * can be positioned from 0xa0 to 0xbf.
 *
 * I realize that the above description is a bit complex, and it doesn't
 * really cover much of _how_ my program decodes the the encoded values.
 * If you honestly can't understand a word I've said, just go back to
 * the table and really take a long look at it.  Print it out, put it
 * under your pillow when you go to sleep.  Sooner or later the order
 * of it all will dawn on you and you should be able to step through
 * my code and see how it derives its answer, at least for the
 * DecodeCharOne() routine.  Seven other tables (which I have rough
 * copies of here on notebook paper) were needed to come up with
 * the seven other decoders for the seven other character places.
