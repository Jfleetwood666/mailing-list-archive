&gt; THE WOBBLIES:
&gt;
&gt; Tactics and Vision for a New Workers' Movement
&gt;
&gt; An Introduction to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)
&gt;
&gt; ISN'T THE IWW JUST FOR FACTORY WORKERS?
&gt;
&gt; Every worker is an "industrial" worker - whether they work in health
&gt; care, tourism, education, or publishing. The relatively recent
&gt; association between the word "industry" and heavy manufacturing is
&gt; misleading, and was never intended to be by the founders of the IWW.
&gt; If you earn your living by working with your hands or your mind,
&gt; then you're welcome in the IWW. Only bosses (defined as those with
&gt; direct power to hire and fire) are excluded from IWW membership.
&gt;
&gt; The Wobblies (as members of the IWW are known) have historically
&gt; focused on helping organize those workers that the American
&gt; Federation of Labor (AFL) shunned. In the early 1900s that meant
&gt; African-Americans, immigrants, women, and unskilled laborers. Today
&gt; that means curbside recyclers, non-profit staffers, temp workers,
&gt; sex-industry workers, co-op employees -- in short, any worker in any
&gt; workplace regardless of size or structure.
&gt;
&gt; CAN THE IWW HELP ME TO IMPROVE THE WAGES OR WORKING CONDITIONS AT MY
&gt; CURRENT JOB?
&gt;
&gt; That largely depends on you. The IWW is a "do-it-yourself" union,
&gt; and does not provide an all-knowing leadership or hefty treasury to
&gt; fight your battles for you. But if you're willing to organize at
&gt; your job-site by talking with your co-workers about the issues that
&gt; matter to them, then you can count on your fellow workers in the IWW
&gt; to lend their full support to your struggle.
&gt;
&gt; Individual workers can accomplish little by themselves, and are
&gt; liable to be fired if they raise their voice in protest. But by
&gt; joining together in a union such as the IWW, workers are far more
&gt; powerful when confronting their boss about workplace injustices. Our
&gt; union can provide tangible, community-based resources such as
&gt; low-cost printing, speakers, legal advise, and how-to manuals, as
&gt; well as bodies on a picket line. You won't get bureaucrats in suits
&gt; and ties telling you how to run your strike, just friends lending a
&gt; hand where they can.
&gt;
&gt; THE IWW AND MAINSTREAM LABOR
&gt;
&gt; For almost a century, the leadership of the AFL-CIO has worked hand
&gt; in hand with the capitalists to squelch rank and file militancy.
&gt; Their overriding concern has been "industrial harmony," not economic
&gt; and social justice, and so they fail to question the most basic
&gt; assumptions of capitalist production. While union bosses play golf
&gt; with the titans of industry, real wages and safety conditions have
&gt; continued to worsen these last thirty years or so.
&gt;
&gt; Regular AFL trade unions split workers up into their respective
&gt; skills, allowing one craft union to cross the picket line of
&gt; another. The IWW believes in "industrial unionism," organizing all
&gt; workers in a given industry into the same union (thus our name). At
&gt; a construction site, for instance, the carpenters should be able to
&gt; count on the unswerving support of the plumbers, laborers,
&gt; electricians, and hod carriers in the event of a strike. This is
&gt; much simpler when all these workers are in the same industrial
&gt; union, rather than separate, even competing, trade unions.
&gt;
&gt; Some Wobblies find themselves in jobs where they are represented by
&gt; these more conservative trade unions. These "two- card" Wobs often
&gt; bring their IWW principles to the union hall with them, agitating
&gt; for rank and file democracy, more militant "direct action" tactics,
&gt; and class solidarity. The IWW does not believe in signing away the
&gt; right to strike ( the so-called "no strike" clause), nor does it
&gt; condone the "dues check-off," in which management deducts union dues
&gt; directly from the paycheck. While the IWW often does strike support
&gt; for other unions when necessary, we also try to keep our sights on
&gt; the bigger prize ahead.
&gt;
&gt; DIDN'T THE IWW DIE OUT? ARE ITS IDEAS STILL RELEVANT?
&gt;
&gt; The IWW was nearly crushed in the early 1920's by some of the
&gt; fiercest repression ever unleashed by big business and the U.S.
&gt; government. Because the IWW had strongholds in industries that were
&gt; critical to the First World War effort, and because they refused to
&gt; do their patriotic bit by signing no-strike pledges for the duration
&gt; of the war, the Wobblies were branded "pro-German" and relentlessly
&gt; persecuted.
&gt;
&gt; The world economy has changed a lot since the days when the IWW
&gt; controlled great sections of the logging, mining, and agricultural
&gt; industries. Yet despite tremendous technological advances and the
&gt; structural reorganization of capital, industrial unionism remains a
&gt; fundamentally sound basis for workers' self- organization. Today,
&gt; while mainstream labor tries desperately to hold its ground against
&gt; the anti-worker policies of the ruling political parties, vast new
&gt; sectors of the economy have opened up that the AFL-CIO would never
&gt; dream of organizing.
&gt;
&gt; Whether they be fast-food workers, word processors, or micro- chip
&gt; assemblers, today's non-union wage workers need the IWW's brand of
&gt; no-compromise unionism even more than their predecessors. Winning
&gt; the eight-hour day was not enough. We must redefine the very meaning
&gt; of work itself, and find ways to redistribute society's wealth for
&gt; the benefit of all.
&gt;
&gt; DOES THE IWW SUPPORT ANY POLITICAL PARTY?
&gt;
&gt; The IWW is a labor union, not a political party. We believe that
&gt; economic justice must be achieved through economic struggle, whether
&gt; that be with our boss or our landlord. The institutions of
&gt; government have always proven themselves to be the allies of
&gt; Capital, so we do not wait for politicians to free us from wage-
&gt; slavery. We believe our power lies in the workplace, not in "the
&gt; vote" - since it is our labor on which bosses are dependent.
&gt;
&gt; The IWW has successfully resisted attempts by various "left" parties
&gt; to make the union a mere tool of their political ambitions. Our
&gt; Constitution explicitly states "the IWW refuses all alliances,
&gt; direct and indirect, with existing parties and anti-political
&gt; sects." This policy has helped us avoid the sectarian feuding that
&gt; can easily destroy a group.
&gt;
&gt; True, our commitment to worker control and the abolition of
&gt; capitalism has not won us any friends among the ruling elites, and
&gt; our disavowal of all political party affiliation has not prevented
&gt; us from being red-baited. We address the root causes of this
&gt; society's problems, and that makes us "radical," but we have the
&gt; common sense to leave our electoral political views outside the
&gt; union hall where they belong.
&gt;
&gt; WHAT IS DIRECT ACTION?
&gt;
&gt; The labor movement has been most successful when it relied on the
&gt; direct intervention of the workers to obtain their demands. Rather
&gt; than allowing professional negotiators to speak for them, Wobblies
&gt; have engaged in those tactics which they could control themselves --
&gt; strikes, slowdowns, monkey wrenching -- what we call sabotage.
&gt;
&gt; Sabotage in this context does not mean arson and dynamite. It's more
&gt; properly defined as "the conscious withdrawal of efficiency."
&gt; Staying at your workstation but reducing your production by half
&gt; will bring a boss to his knees quicker than a whole team of
&gt; negotiators.
&gt;
&gt; The IWW has never advocated violence. By fighting for justice with
&gt; non-violent tactics, the IWW has often won the support of an
&gt; initially mistrustful public.
&gt;
&gt; WHAT IS A GENERAL STRIKE?
&gt;
&gt; The General Strike has long been touted by militant unionists as the
&gt; ultimate expression of workers' power, and it still plays an
&gt; important role in the IWW's program for social change. Simply put, a
&gt; General strike is a massive work stoppage on a local, regional, or
&gt; national scale, and may involve people either staying home or
&gt; occupying their workplaces and refusing to work.
&gt;
&gt; A General Strike halts business as usual, and serves notice to those
&gt; in power that those of us doing the work have the ultimate say in
&gt; whether that work gets done or not. It debunks the myth that power
&gt; flows downward, and proves instead that all real power still resides
&gt; at the grassroots level, if we only choose to exercise it.
&gt;
&gt; The general Strike is a common tactic in many countries of the
&gt; world, yet most North American workers are unfamiliar with it. This
&gt; is largely the result of the conservative trade unions' reluctance
&gt; to flex their economic muscle and rock the boat. A great deal of
&gt; education and organization must take place before North American
&gt; workers are ready to wage a successful General Strike, and it's
&gt; toward this end that the IWW dedicates itself.
&gt;
&gt; THE IWW AND FEMINISM
&gt;
&gt; Women have been active in the IWW since its inception. Elizabeth
&gt; Gurley Flynn, one of the union's best know agitators, once said that
&gt; "the IWW has been accused of pushing women to the front. This is not
&gt; true. Rather, the women have not been kept in back, and so they have
&gt; naturally moved to the front."
&gt;
&gt; Much of the work that has traditionally been done by women was not
&gt; recognized as such by the male-run business unions. The IWW supports
&gt; the right of homemakers, sex-industry workers, and other women to
&gt; organize for better conditions and wages just like other workers.
&gt;
&gt; THE IWW AND MILITARISM
&gt;
&gt; Wars between nations have never benefitted the working class, and
&gt; they never will. The war profiteers, safe in their mansions and
&gt; boardrooms, never consider the human cost of their military
&gt; adventurism. Working people are mere cannon fodder for their
&gt; corporate and imperialist ambitions.
&gt;
&gt; Real working class solidarity does not recognize the artificial
&gt; borders erected between nation-states, but instead unites against a
&gt; common class enemy. Poor people, especially those of color, make up
&gt; a disproportionate part of the armed forces, simply because few
&gt; other economic options are available.
&gt;
&gt; To put an end to war, working people must lay down their arms and
&gt; refuse to fight for their masters. Unfortunately, many have been
&gt; brainwashed into thinking that their interests are the same as those
&gt; of the people in power, so this is easier said than done.
&gt; Nevertheless, the IWW is committed to fighting patriotic propaganda
&gt; by educating workers about where their real self-interest lies.
&gt;
&gt; THE IWW AND THE ENVIRONMENT
&gt;
&gt; Bhopal, Chernobyl, the Exxon Valdez oil spill... These are just a
&gt; few examples of how dangerous it can be to put profit before people.
&gt; Government regulation and public outcry can at best slow down the
&gt; destruction of our planet, not reverse it.
&gt;
&gt; Workers and their families suffer the worst effects of pollution.
&gt; The workplace continues to be a very dangerous environment, and
&gt; working class communities are often the site for toxic dumps,
&gt; incinerators, and the like.
&gt;
&gt; Workers' control of all industry is the only practical strategy for
&gt; assuring the practice of sustainable and environmentally sound forms
&gt; of production. For if the workers in all polluting industries were
&gt; to withdraw their labor, the poison factories could be shut down in
&gt; a matter of weeks. The workers themselves must decide whether or not
&gt; what they produce is socially useful.
&gt;
&gt; JOIN THE I.W.W.
&gt;
&gt; NO BUREAUCRATS - Aside from the modestly paid General
&gt; Secretary/Treasurer, the I.W.W. has no paid officers. The General
&gt; Executive Board is elected annually by the entire membership, and
&gt; its job is to oversee the running of union affairs, not to set
&gt; policy. All officers may be recalled at any time by referendum.
&gt;
&gt; REAL DEMOCRACY - All policy decisions are made by the members
&gt; themselves by referendum. All branches maintain full autonomy on
&gt; matters within their jurisdiction. Job branches (I.W.W. groups
&gt; composed of workers at a single job-site) set their own demands and
&gt; strategies in negotiations, free of meddling internaitonals or
&gt; sellout business agents.
&gt;
&gt; LOW DUES - Our dues are structured on a sliding scale basis.
&gt; Unemployed and low-income workers pay $5 a month; those making
&gt; between $800 and $1,700 per month pay $9; members making more than
&gt; $1,700 per month pay $12 monthly dues; and workers in extremely poor
&gt; financial situations may pay only $3 per month. Initiation fees
&gt; equal one month's dues; so a very low-income worker can join for as
&gt; little as $6.
&gt;
&gt; TO JOIN - Fill out the questions below and send a copy of this form
&gt; with your check or money order (in U.S. funds) to I.W.W., 103 W.

&gt; newspaper, the Industrial Worker, in addition to your membership
&gt; card, constitution, button, and the One Big Union pamphlet which
&gt; describes the structure and function of the I.W.W. in detail. You'll
&gt; also start to get a monthly publication for members only called the
&gt; General Organization Bulletin, which contains Board motions,
&gt; financial reports, and members' discussion of various internal
&gt; matters such as upcoming referenda. And if you have access to email,
&gt; you'll be invited to join a growing network of Wobblies engaging in
&gt; on-line communications.
&gt;
&gt; IWW PREAMBLE
&gt;
&gt; The working class and the employing class have nothing in common.
&gt; There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among
&gt; millions of working people; and the few, who make up the employing
&gt; class, have all the good things in life.
&gt;
&gt; Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of
&gt; the world organize as a class, take possession of the machinery of
&gt; production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the
&gt; earth.
&gt;
&gt; We find that the centering of the management of industries into
&gt; fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the
&gt; ever growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a
&gt; state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted
&gt; against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping
&gt; to defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid
&gt; the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the
&gt; working class has interests in common with its employers.
&gt;
&gt; These conditions can be changed and the interests of the working
&gt; class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all
&gt; its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary,
&gt; cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department
&gt; thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to all.
&gt;
&gt; Instead of the conservative motto, "A fair day's wage for a fair
&gt; day's work," we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary
&gt; watchword, "Abolition of the wage system."
&gt;
&gt; It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with
&gt; capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only for
&gt; the everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on
&gt; production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By organizing
&gt; industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within
&gt; the shell of the old.
