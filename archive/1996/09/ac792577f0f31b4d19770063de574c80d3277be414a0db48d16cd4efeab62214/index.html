&gt; &gt;Amen to that.  Add that at least one lawyer (and former prosecutor) on 
&gt; &gt;the list is confident that successful prosecutions will ensue is AP ever 
&gt; &gt;gets off the ground. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't doubt that there will be harassment.  (you can't deny that charges 
&gt; would be brought even if it is tacitly agreed that no crime has been 
&gt; committed; "the harassment-value" of such a prosecution would be desired 
&gt; even if there is ultimately an acquittal.)  AP will resemble, more than 
&gt; anything, gambling.  While gambling is illegal in some areas, it is quite 
&gt; legal in others and there is no reason to believe that locales can't be 
&gt; found in which an AP system could operate legally.

By "successful prosecutions" I mean convictions.  You can call a cow a 
duck, but it's still a cow. 



&gt; Make American laws apply everywhere?  That'll be hard to justify, unless you 

You obviously are unfamiliar with the established concept of 
extraterritorial jurisdiction.

&gt; want to unleash a world where an all people can be subject simultaneously to 
&gt; the laws of EVERY country, should they choose to enforce them!  Would you 
&gt; like to be arrested in Red China for something you said years earlier in 
&gt; America about their leadership? 
&gt; 
&gt;  And are you ignoring the fact that the intentional isolation of one 
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^
Are you ignoring the principle of "willful blindness"?

&gt; participant from the knowledge of the actions and even the identity of the 
&gt; others makes opportunities for prosecution on "conspiracy" charges mighty 
&gt; slim.  And since AP can operate across traditional jurisdictional

I'm curious as to your qualifications to make the "mighty slim" judgment ...


 
&gt; boundaries, you're going to have to explain how you can prosecute Person A 
&gt; in Country B for giving a donation to an organization in Country C, to be 
&gt; paid to a person D in country E for correctly predicting the death of person 
&gt; F in country G, particularly when none of the identities of these people or 
&gt; countries can be easily known given a well-crafted cryptographic and 
&gt; message-routing system.  

Be glad too.  How much can you afford?

&gt; 
&gt;   Further, as you probably know as well as any, in order (at least, 
&gt; supposedly!) to get a conviction you need to prove "mens rea," or "guilty 
&gt; mind," and I suggest that none of the more passive participants in the AP 
&gt; system have that.  (The ones who DON'T pick up a gun, knife, bomb, poison, 
&gt; etc.)  Sure, they are aware that somewhere, sometime, somebody _may_ commit 
&gt; a crime in order to collect a lottery, but they don't know who, what, when, 
&gt; where, or how this will occur, if at all. (either before or after the fact!) 
&gt;   In fact, since it is possible for a target to collect the reward himself 
&gt; (to be directed toward his designee, obviously) by committing suicide and 
&gt; "predicting" it, it isn't certain to the other participants that there has 
&gt; even been any sort of crime committed!

Moo moo.* 


&gt; Based on the mens rea requirement, I propose that there is plenty of room 
&gt; for most of the participants to reasonably claim that they are guilty of no 
&gt; crime.  They have carefully shielded themselves and others from any guilty 
&gt; knowledge, and presumably they are entitled to protect themselves in this 
&gt; way.  Morally, you could argue that these people are countenancing something 
&gt; nasty, in the same sense that somebody could equally well argue that if you 
&gt; buy a cheap shirt in Walmart you're partly responsible for sweatshop labor 
&gt; in El Salvador.  True, I suppose, but moral guilt does not always translate 
&gt; into legal guilt.
&gt; 

Moo moo.*
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And yes, I've read Jim Bell's manifesto.  The fact 
&gt; &gt;that no lawyer has dissected it from a legal standpoint has been used by 
&gt; &gt;Mr. Bell as support for the propostion that it is legal.
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest that there is a greater likelihood that the "powers that be" will 
&gt; just abandon all pretense of legality, and attempt to strike at the 
&gt; participants if they can find them without benefit of any sort of trial. 
&gt; This is a more plausible conclusion, because it cuts through all of the 
&gt; legal difficulties which would hinder prosecution.  In effect, a low-level 
&gt; undeclared war.  

I disagree that that will be the response, but you should be willing to 
allow one group of people to fight fire with fire.
