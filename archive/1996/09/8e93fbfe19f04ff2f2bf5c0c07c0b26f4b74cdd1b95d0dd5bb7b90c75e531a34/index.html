&gt;
&gt;Do you wonder what happens to civilians unwilling to lie down for
&gt;police abuse of power?  Daniel Allan Tuffree, 49, a former high school
&gt;teacher, the testimony in whose trial ended yesterday, has been charged
&gt;with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Officer Michael Clark
&gt;13 months ago, after three warrantless police officers traipsed on his
&gt;front lawn with their guns drawn -- to check on his welfare.  The case,
&gt;which is presided over by the notoriously prosecution-friendly Judge
&gt;Allan L. Steele in the Simi Valley courthouse that hosted the acquittal
&gt;of Rodney King's uniformed assailants in their first trial, will go to
&gt;the jury in early October after jury instructions are drawn and lawyers
&gt;make their closing arguments.  Tuffree faces a possible death sentence.
&gt;
&gt;Clark was one of three police officers sent to Tuffree's home on
&gt;August 4, 1995, after reports that the former Chatsworth High School
&gt;teacher had been drinking alcohol, taking Valium and was possibly
&gt;suicidal.  A gunfight began shortly after police walked into Tuffree's
&gt;backyard and started asking him questions, refusing his order to leave
&gt;his property.  Defense attorneys have argued that Clark fired on
&gt;Tuffree first and that police acted improperly. They called expert
&gt;witnesses who testified that police should have walked away once they
&gt;realized that Tuffree was not hurt or suicidal.
&gt;
&gt;Lou Reiter, a retired Los Angeles Police Department commander,
&gt;testified that Simi Valley police officers made one mistake after
&gt;another when they came to Tuffree's home.  According to Reiter's
&gt;testimony, the three police officers were working with third-hand
&gt;information when they arrived at the scene.  Before taking action,
&gt;they did not devise a plan in case a confrontation occurred with
&gt;Tuffree, who was a known gun owner.  And they did not announce
&gt;themselves before walking into Tuffree's backyard with their guns
&gt;drawn, all actions that could have aggravated a distraught man who
&gt;reportedly had been drinking alcohol, taking Valium and who had
&gt;stopped answering his phone.  "No one had anticipated or made an
&gt;evaluation of what would happen if things didn't go right," said
&gt;Reiter, a private consultant on police procedure who was an LAPD
&gt;officer for 20 years.  He also told the jury that he believed Simi
&gt;Valley Police Sergeant Anthony Anzilotti to have been negligible in
&gt;his role as the supervising officer on scene that day, testifying that
&gt;"in [his] opinion [Anzilotti] didn't supervise at all."  And he said
&gt;Clark erred by not walking away from Tuffree's kitchen window once he
&gt;realized the former schoolteacher was conscious and not injured: "The
&gt;emergency is over; therefore, the right to be in his backyard is
&gt;over."
&gt;
&gt;Reiter denied the claims of two other police experts called by the
&gt;prosecution, both of whom testified that Simi Valley police officers
&gt;sent to Tuffree's house last summer had a "moral, ethical, and legal"
&gt;obligation to follow through with the request to check on Tuffree's
&gt;welfare, having no choice but to get close enough to make direct
&gt;contact with Tuffree in order to ensure that he was safe.  But Reiter,
&gt;who retired from the LAPD in 1981, said that "officers always have a
&gt;choice," explaining that there are situations in which police can walk
&gt;away once they have determined that a person is safe.  "There are a
&gt;lot of people in their homes that are not confronting a medical
&gt;emergency who just want to be left alone," he said.
