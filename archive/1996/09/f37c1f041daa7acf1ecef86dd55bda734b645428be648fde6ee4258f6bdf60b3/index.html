checking my files and verifying the number this morning, I find that there 
is an active 1-800 number to call Congress.  (Don't know who'se it is, but 
it reaches the Congressional switchboard...)

The Capitol Switchboard can be reached at 1-800-962-3524.

&gt;________________________________________________________________________
&gt;THE LATEST NEWS
&gt;
&gt;Sometimes things work out better than imagined.  This was the feeling
&gt;tonight as I waded through my email from people all over the country that
&gt;called the commerce committee.  This was the feeling as I heard from visitors
&gt;to one Senator's office who, while waiting for a few minutes in the lobby,
&gt;listened to the receptionist take two quick calls from netizens calling
&gt;about the bill.
&gt;
&gt;Receptionist, cutting the caller off: "S.1726?  Yes, I'll pass that along
&gt;to the Senator, thanks.  We've been getting a lot of calls."
&gt;
&gt;Another netizen emailed us saying that he also called his Representative.
&gt;It turns out this Rep. has some friends who have co-sponsored HR 3011, the
&gt;House version of Pro-CODE.  The calls and elevated publicity from this phone
&gt;campaign have convinced him to consider co-sponsoring HR 3011.
&gt;
&gt;This is great, but our success has mobilized the anti-crypto forces
&gt;into action as well.  The Clinton Administration, who has long opposed
&gt;the right of citizens to use non-Clipper encryption, has begun working
&gt;behind the scenes to make sure that the vote on Pro-CODE (S.1726) never
&gt;happens.
&gt;
&gt;To have the Senate Commerce committee go on record that encryption exports
&gt;should be loosened, against the will of the Administration, would be
&gt;an embarrassment to the White House.  They have begun pushing hard to
&gt;pressure Democratic Commerce Committee members to put the brakes on the
&gt;bill, and do everything they can to prevent the vote this Thursday.
&gt;
&gt;To see the business community, the industry, and the public line up the
&gt;Administration would be extremely hard to take and still seem
&gt;credible.
&gt;
&gt;It's crucial that we continue to make noise and ring those phones.  By
&gt;pulling enough favors with members of the Senate Commerce Committee, it's
&gt;possible that the White House could prevent this vote from happening.
&gt;
&gt;WE MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.  Appropriately forward this to everyone you
&gt;know until the expiration listed above.  Go to work, bug your neighbor
&gt;in the cubicle or office next to you.  Have they called yet?  Bug them
&gt;until they do.  Call the rest of the members you haven't gotten around to
&gt;yet.
&gt;
&gt;And don't forget to sign the petition at http://www.crypto.com/petition/ !
&gt;
&gt;[Rest of alert is the same from last time]
&gt;________________________________________________________________________
&gt;WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW
&gt;
&gt;It's crucial that you call the Commerce committee members below and
&gt;urge them to pass S.1726 out of committee without amendments.  (This is
&gt;also known as a "clean" bill.)  Any opportunity for amendments (even if
&gt;they are good) opens us up to the possibility of hostile amendments
&gt;that could restrict the use of encryption even further than today's
&gt;abysmal state.  It could even prohibit the use of encryption without
&gt;Clipper Chip-like key 'escrow' technology, which includes built-in
&gt;surveillance and monitoring functionality.
&gt;
&gt;1. Call/Fax the members of the Senate Commerce committee and urge
&gt;   them to pass S.1726 out of committee "cleanly".  Do not use email,
&gt;   as it is not likely to be looked at in time to make a difference
&gt;   for the markup on September 12th.
&gt;
&gt;   Use the sample communique and directory listing below to make it a
&gt;   simple TWO MINUTE task.
&gt;
&gt;2. Sign the petition to support strong encryption at
&gt;   http://www.crypto.com/petition/   !  Join other cyber-heroes as
&gt;   Phil Zimmermann, Matt Blaze, Bruce Schneier, Vince Cate, Phil Karn, and
&gt;   others who have also signed.
&gt;
&gt;3. Between now and Wed. September 12, it is crucial that you call all
&gt;   these members of Congress.

&gt;	it on Thursday.  It's critical to the future of privacy, security,
&gt;	and electronic commerce on the internet.
&gt;
&gt;	Sen:Ok, thanks!&lt;click&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   IF THEY SAY
&gt;	"The Senator has concerns about the bill",
&gt;   please answer,
&gt;   	"Please try to work these issues out as it moves to the Senate floor,
&gt;	 but passage out of committee will send an important signal to

&gt;________________________________________________________________________
&gt;BACKGROUND / WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK
&gt;
&gt;For the past 3 years, Cyber-Rights Activists, citizens, and industry
&gt;leaders have been working hard to reform US encryption policy.
&gt;
&gt;Support has been building behind several legislative proposals this
&gt;year because they send a clear signal to the Administration about the
&gt;need for security and privacy in the Information Age.  The digital
&gt;revolution is currently being held hostage by the White House's Cold
&gt;War restrictions on privacy-enhancing encryption technology.
&gt;
&gt;Now, with Congress less than a month away from adjournment, everyone
&gt;who supports encryption and privacy is working to see this bill leave
&gt;committee in order to send a clear message to the White House that they
&gt;are on the wrong side of the encryption issue.  Although this bill may
&gt;not become law this year, its passage out of committee will be a
&gt;landmark event that will clearly tell the White House that the
&gt;Congress, the public, and the computer industry care about security and
&gt;privacy, and need strong, reliable encryption technology in order to
&gt;make the Internet a viable platform for commerce, education, and
&gt;democracy.
&gt;
&gt;Success for our side is not certain, and the next week is not without risks.
&gt;On September 12th, the Senate Commerce committee will hold a "markup",
&gt;where the bill is examined, voted on, and if there are enough votes,
&gt;passed out of committee.  Two things could happen:
&gt;
&gt;	-the committee could pass the bill as written,
&gt;	-the committee could pass the bill with amendments.
&gt;
&gt;Any amendments are not likely to be friendly, and in particular, quiet
&gt;sources have told privacy activists that the Clinton Administration has been
&gt;readying a legislative assault on your right to use encryption for several
&gt;weeks now.  A Clipper-like amendment could be attached to the bill if
&gt;our side does not have enough votes to block all amendments.
&gt;
&gt;It is crucial that all netizens who consider privacy and security important
&gt;take a moment to call members of the Commerce Committee right now and
&gt;urge them to vote S.1726 out of committee without amendments.
&gt;
&gt;________________________________________________________________________
&gt;DESCRIPTION OF S.1726, PRO-CODE BILL
&gt;
&gt;Privacy-enhancing encryption technology is currently under heavy restrictions
&gt;kept in place by the White House.  Encryption that is currently allowed to
&gt;be exported is not sufficient to protect confidential information.  This
&gt;policy acquires an "Alice-in-Wonderland" quality when one realizes that  
&gt;strong encryption products are available abroad both for sale and for free
&gt;download off the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;The Pro-CODE Act resolves to:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Allow for the *unrestricted* export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
&gt;    encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and
&gt;    popular World Wide Web browsers.
&gt;
&gt;2.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to allow the less restricted export
&gt;    of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
&gt;    generally available outside the United States, roughly up to DES
&gt;    strength.
&gt;
&gt;3.  Prohibits the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
&gt;    encryption policies on the domestic market and limiting the authority
&gt;    of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.
&gt;
&gt;________________________________________________________________________
&gt;CHRONOLOGY OF PRO-CRYPTO LEGISLATION
&gt;
&gt;9/12/96 (scheduled)
&gt;Senate Commerce committee will hold markup of S.1726 and hopefully pass it
&gt;out of committee with no amendments.
&gt;
&gt;7/25/96: Full Senate Commerce committee holds positive hearings on S.1726.
&gt;FBI Director Louis Freeh testifies along with many cyber-luminaries.
&gt;Hearings are cybercast Internet Cyber-Rights activists with HotWired
&gt;and WWW.Crypto.Com.  You can see the photos, read the testimony, and
&gt;listen to the audio transcript at http://www.crypto.com/events/072596/
&gt;
&gt;6/26/96: Senate subcommittee holds positive hearings on S.1726.  Hearings are
&gt;cybercast Internet Cyber-Rights activists with HotWired and WWW.Crypto.Com.
&gt;You can see the photos, read the testimony, and listen to the audio
&gt;transcript at http://www.crypto.com/events/062696/
&gt;
&gt;5/2/96: Bi-partisan group of Senators introduce Pro-CODE Act, which would
&gt;free public-domain encryption software (such as PGP) for export, free much
&gt;commercial encryption for export, and reduce the government's ability to
&gt;push Clipper proposals down the throats of an unwilling public.  Original
&gt;sponsors include: Senators Burns (R-MT), Dole (R-KS), Faircloth (R-NC),
&gt;Leahy (D-VT), Murray (D-WA), Pressler (R-SD), and Wyden (D-OR).
&gt;
&gt;3/5/96: Sen. Leahy (D-VT) and Rep. Goodlatte (R-VA) announce encryption bills
&gt;(S.1587/H.R.3011) that significantly relax export restrictions on products
&gt;with encryption functionality in them, as well as free public domain software
&gt;such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).
