On Thu, 18 Apr 1996, the intrepid anonymous-remailer@shell.portal.com
FUDded to cypherpunks:

&gt; [Congressional Record: April 17, 1996 (Senate)]
&gt; [Page S3454-S3478]

[fascinating but probably out-of-context remarks from Biden, suggesting
that we should all don our tin-foil hats in fear of the FBI rabdar vans,
deleted]

I cannot find the referenced remarks.  Assuming the selection is accurate,
it is abundantly clear that Binden continued speaking beyond where you so
ominously chose to cut him off. Could you give me a *specific* URL? Or a
way to get static page number URLs? I can only figure out how to search
http://thomas.loc.gov/ and get temp URLs.

I *did* read Biden's *highly entertaining* comments on the contentious
Internet Baby Food Bomb Issue, from the conference report mentioned by the
redoubtable Mr. Anonymous. Thanks so much for pointing me to this debate;
it almost makes still being in my office worthwile.

Does anyone know the documents that Senator Biden is quoting? I *must
know* how to build The Dreaded Baby-Food Bomb.

  **I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP. THIS IS YOUR UNITED STATES SENATE AT WORK.**

&gt;From the April 17th Congressional Record, what page I unfortunately cant
tell you, because Thomas and/or I suck:


Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use within the
limit of the time I have.

This provision is very straightforward and simple. It is beyond me why it
was taken out of the Senate version of the language that was sent to the
House.

I have heard many colleagues stand up on the floor here and rail against
pornography on the Internet, and for good reason.  Even when we thought we
had corrected the language that Senator Exon introduced to comport with
the first amendment, I still hear in my State, and I hear of people
writing about how so and so is promoting pornography on the Internet
because they will not ban pornography on the Internet.

Yet, in the bill, we came along--all of us here--and the genesis of this
came from Senator Feinstein, when it was initially offered. The majority
leader, Senator Hatch, and I had some concerns with this, and we thought
the language to ban teaching people how to make bombs on the Internet or
engage in terrorist activities on the Internet might violate the first
amendment. Senators Dole, Hatch, and I worked to tighten the language and
came up with language that was tough and true to civil liberties. It was
accepted by unanimous consent.

We have all heard about the bone-chilling information making its way over
the Internet, about explicit instructions about how to detonate pipe bombs
and even, if you can believe it, baby food bombs. Senator Feinstein quoted
an Internet posting that detailed how to build and explode one of these
things, which concludes that `If the explosion don't get'em, the glass
will. If the glass don't get'em, the nails will.'

I would like to give you a couple of illustrations of the kinds of things
that come across the Internet. This is one I have in my hand which was
downloaded. It said, `Baby food bombs by War Master.' And this is actually
downloaded off the Internet. It says:

These simple, powerful bombs are not very well known, even though all of
the materials can be obtained by anyone (including minors). These things
are so--

I will delete a word because it is an obscenity.

powerful that they can destroy a CAR. The explosion can actually twist and
mangle the frame. They are extremely deadly and can very easily kill you
and blow the side of a house out if you mess up while building it. Here is
how they work.

This is on the Internet now. It says:

Go to Sports Authority or Herman's Sport Shop and buy shotgun shells. It
is by the hunting section. At the Sports Authority that I go to you can
actually buy shotgun shells without a parent or an adult. They don't keep
it behind the glass counter, or anything like that. It is $2.96 for 25
shells.

And then it says:

Now for the hard part. You must cut open the plastic housing of the bullet
to get to the sweet nectar that is the gun powder. The place where you can
cut is CRUCIAL. It means a difference between it blowing up in your face
or not.

Then there is a diagram, which is shown as to how to do that on the
Internet. Then it says:

You must not make the cut directly where the gun powder is, or it will
explode. You cut it where the pellets are.

And then it goes through this in detail. And then it gets to the end, and
it says:

Did I mention that this is also highly illegal? Unimportant stuff that is
cool to know.

And then it rates shotgun shells by two numbers, gauge, pellet size, and
goes into great detail. It is like building an erector set. It does it in
detail.
