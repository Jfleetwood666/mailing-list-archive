You have to be pretty damn stupid if you need to go out and surf the 'net 
to find out that gunpowder can be found in shotgun shells.

Big news flash: you can find fertilzer at the hardware store, rust on  your
daddy's Chevy, and bird doodoo in the back yard.  Anybody who wants 
to figure out how to make explosives and CAN'T is too stupid to have 
graduated from high school (and probably too stupid to navigate the 
'net). They're much more likely to go down to the local surplus store, 
and learn all this out of old U.S. military training manuals than to find 
it on the 'net.

Who voted for these morons? They are only doing this because anything 
involving the 'net will get their NAMES IN THE NEWS.

&gt; &gt; [Congressional Record: April 17, 1996 (Senate)]
&gt; &gt; [Page S3454-S3478]
&gt; 
&gt; [fascinating but probably out-of-context remarks from Biden, suggesting
&gt; that we should all don our tin-foil hats in fear of the FBI rabdar vans,
&gt; deleted]
&gt; 
&gt; I cannot find the referenced remarks.  Assuming the selection is accurate,
&gt; it is abundantly clear that Binden continued speaking beyond where you so
&gt; ominously chose to cut him off. Could you give me a *specific* URL? Or a
&gt; way to get static page number URLs? I can only figure out how to search
&gt; http://thomas.loc.gov/ and get temp URLs.
&gt; 
&gt; I *did* read Biden's *highly entertaining* comments on the contentious
&gt; Internet Baby Food Bomb Issue, from the conference report mentioned by the
&gt; redoubtable Mr. Anonymous. Thanks so much for pointing me to this debate;
&gt; it almost makes still being in my office worthwile.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know the documents that Senator Biden is quoting? I *must
&gt; know* how to build The Dreaded Baby-Food Bomb.
&gt; 
&gt;   **I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP. THIS IS YOUR UNITED STATES SENATE AT WORK.**
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the April 17th Congressional Record, what page I unfortunately cant
&gt; tell you, because Thomas and/or I suck:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use within the
&gt; limit of the time I have.
&gt; 
&gt; This provision is very straightforward and simple. It is beyond me why it
&gt; was taken out of the Senate version of the language that was sent to the
&gt; House.
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard many colleagues stand up on the floor here and rail against
&gt; pornography on the Internet, and for good reason.  Even when we thought we
&gt; had corrected the language that Senator Exon introduced to comport with
&gt; the first amendment, I still hear in my State, and I hear of people
&gt; writing about how so and so is promoting pornography on the Internet
&gt; because they will not ban pornography on the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet, in the bill, we came along--all of us here--and the genesis of this
&gt; came from Senator Feinstein, when it was initially offered. The majority
&gt; leader, Senator Hatch, and I had some concerns with this, and we thought
&gt; the language to ban teaching people how to make bombs on the Internet or
&gt; engage in terrorist activities on the Internet might violate the first
&gt; amendment. Senators Dole, Hatch, and I worked to tighten the language and
&gt; came up with language that was tough and true to civil liberties. It was
&gt; accepted by unanimous consent.
&gt; 
&gt; We have all heard about the bone-chilling information making its way over
&gt; the Internet, about explicit instructions about how to detonate pipe bombs
&gt; and even, if you can believe it, baby food bombs. Senator Feinstein quoted
&gt; an Internet posting that detailed how to build and explode one of these
&gt; things, which concludes that `If the explosion don't get'em, the glass
&gt; will. If the glass don't get'em, the nails will.'
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to give you a couple of illustrations of the kinds of things
&gt; that come across the Internet. This is one I have in my hand which was
&gt; downloaded. It said, `Baby food bombs by War Master.' And this is actually
&gt; downloaded off the Internet. It says:
&gt; 
&gt; These simple, powerful bombs are not very well known, even though all of
&gt; the materials can be obtained by anyone (including minors). These things
&gt; are so--
&gt; 
&gt; I will delete a word because it is an obscenity.
&gt; 
&gt; powerful that they can destroy a CAR. The explosion can actually twist and
&gt; mangle the frame. They are extremely deadly and can very easily kill you
&gt; and blow the side of a house out if you mess up while building it. Here is
&gt; how they work.
&gt; 
&gt; This is on the Internet now. It says:
&gt; 
&gt; Go to Sports Authority or Herman's Sport Shop and buy shotgun shells. It
&gt; is by the hunting section. At the Sports Authority that I go to you can
&gt; actually buy shotgun shells without a parent or an adult. They don't keep
&gt; it behind the glass counter, or anything like that. It is $2.96 for 25
&gt; shells.
&gt; 
I don't know where this might be - it is illegal in most states to sell 
ammunition to minors. I'm guessing that it is illegal in all states, 
(though Texas has some interesting views).
I used to have to send my mother to the store for .38 wadcutters ... 

&gt; And then it says:
&gt; 
&gt; Now for the hard part. You must cut open the plastic housing of the bullet
&gt; to get to the sweet nectar that is the gun powder. The place where you can
&gt; cut is CRUCIAL. It means a difference between it blowing up in your face
&gt; or not.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there is a diagram, which is shown as to how to do that on the
&gt; Internet. Then it says:
&gt; 
&gt; You must not make the cut directly where the gun powder is, or it will
&gt; explode. You cut it where the pellets are.
&gt; 
Yeah, I think every kid I grew up with did this by the time they were 10 
years old. Back when there were about 10 computers on the internet, and 
none of us had ever seen one. When we were younger, we used to spend 
hours extracting gunpowder from the paper strips used in toy cap pistols 
and cutting the heads off matches.

I wouldn't want my kids playing with things like this, but your kid is
an idiot if they need to surf the 'net to figure out that gunpowder can be
found in ammunition. 

&gt; And then it goes through this in detail. And then it gets to the end, and
&gt; it says:
&gt; 
&gt; Did I mention that this is also highly illegal? Unimportant stuff that is
&gt; cool to know.
&gt; 
&gt; And then it rates shotgun shells by two numbers, gauge, pellet size, and
&gt; goes into great detail. It is like building an erector set. It does it in
&gt; detail.
