This is the message I received which complained about "inappropriate
use of the Internet".  He also phoned me to complain.

I know the cyperpunks already know this, but Dave Farber's audience
might not have thought about the implications for free speech of
having the government build a multi billion dollar Internet
replacement.  Bureaucrats and random complaints from third parties on
such a network *will* cause you grief about what you are allowed to
say and do.  The company I buy networking from is Alternet, and
because they exist, I can protect myself from this sort of meddling.
They will not be able to compete with the taxpayer funded "national
information infrastructure", and my only option, if I want to be on
the net, will be to hook up under the government's rules.

If after seeing this this exchange you still don't believe me, talk to
someone at a controversial broadcast radio station.  Radio is living
under that yoke *now*, and they have some real stories to tell.

John, below is the posting I called about.  In my opinion this is
inappropriate use of the Internet.  This person appears to be a virus
author, one who knows virus authors, and/or one who encourages such
activity. 

What is the policy of toad.com concerning such postings?

Keith

&gt; Subject: Re: Viral encryption
&gt; To: cypherpunks@toad.com
&gt; Date: Thu, 11 Feb 93 11:47:43 EST
&gt; 
&gt; As Mr. Ferguson pointed out, polymorphic viruses are making their way into the
&gt; DOS world.  This is a problem in the short term, but not in the long term
&gt; because people will be changing to memory-protected &amp; file-permission based
&gt; operating systems like NT, OS/2 and Unix, where it is very difficult for
&gt; most kinds of virus to spread.
&gt; 
&gt; I myself am very familiar with the virus underground, so for those who are
&gt; not, let me explain the two newest and most deadly virus techniques which
&gt; are being seen in the DOS world.
&gt; 
&gt; The first is something called "Stealth" viruses.  Stealth viruses imbed
&gt; themselves into DOS and intercept disk read calls from applications. If
&gt; those read system calls are reading non .EXE or .COM files, then they are
&gt; processed normally.  However when an application such as virus scanning
&gt; program is reading in .COM and .EXE files (in order to scan them for virus
&gt; code), the stealth code in DOS intercepts this and returns to the application
&gt; what the .EXE or .COM file would look like if it wasn't infected by the
&gt; stealth virus.  Thus, all virus checking programs can be decieved in this
&gt; manner.  There are steps to get around this, like booting off of a
&gt; write-protected floppy disk (with a clean copy of DOS on it) and running
&gt; the virus checking program directly from that floppy.  But people seldom
&gt; do that, so the stealth technology is a worthwhile one for virus creators
&gt; to pursue.
&gt; 
&gt; The second is called "Polymorphic" viruses.  These are viruses which
&gt; contain a tiny encryption/decryption engine.  The great thing about
&gt; polymorphic viruses is that they encrypt themselves with a different key
&gt; each time they replicate (make a new copy of themselves).  The small
&gt; amount of virus bootstrap code which is not encrypted is changed in each
&gt; replication by dispursing random NOP's throughout the virus boostrap code.
&gt; Thus each sample of polymorphic virus looks completely different to
&gt; virus checking programs.  The virus checking programs cannot use
&gt; "signature" byte strings to detect polymorphic viruses.
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen something called D.A.M.E., also known as Dark Avenger
&gt; Mutation Engine.  This is a freeware polymorphic library/kernel/toolkit
&gt; which allows anyone to take an ordinary virus and wrap it in a polymorphic
&gt; shell.  Thus each new copy of the virus will look completely different
&gt; as it replicates.  D.A.M.E. is a great toolkit for those who want to
&gt; release new viruses but don't have the skills to write a virus from
&gt; scratch.  DAME works very well with Turbo Assembler and MASM.
&gt; I believe that DAME II will be coming out sometime this spring. At
&gt; least that is what the author has promised.  Among the new features
&gt; will be more powerful encryption, stealth capabilities, and compatibility
&gt; with Stacker and DR DOS compressed file systems.  I have read that the
&gt; author of DAME and DAME II will be coming out with a Virus Construction
&gt; Set, which will allow point-n-click building of new viruses using
&gt; object oriented techniques.  It works sort of like a Mr. Potatohead,
&gt; you point and click on the parts/modules you want and it builds it for
&gt; you.  You select the replication method, stealth capability,
&gt; polymorphism, and payload module (there are several payloads, varying
&gt; from playing music and showing graphics, to printing a text message on
&gt; screan, to complete wipe out of the HD). The really wonderful thing
&gt; is that you will be able to build your own modules and link them into
&gt; the virus.  I am sure a flourishing of third-party modules will occur.
&gt; 
&gt; With the VCS, a 9 year old can build a competely new virus just by
&gt; pointing, clicking, and dragging, popping up windows and choosing options.
&gt; 
&gt; My oh my, aren't we in for fun times ahead...
