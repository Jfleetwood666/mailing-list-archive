&gt;Subject: A study of National Cryptography Policy
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Please forward this message to any individual or mailing list
&gt;that you believe should receive it.  Many thanks..
&gt;*********************
&gt;As part of the Defense Authorization Bill for FY 1994, the U.S. Congress
&gt;has asked the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board
&gt;(CSTB) of the National Research Council (NRC) to undertake a study of
&gt;national policy with respect to the use and regulation of cryptography.
&gt;The report of the study committee is due two years after all necessary
&gt;security clearances have been processed, probably sometime summer
&gt;1996, and is subject to NRC review procedures.  The legislation
&gt;states that 120 days after the day on which the report is submitted to
&gt;the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary shall submit the report to the
&gt;Committees on Armed Services, Intelligence, Commerce, and the
&gt;Judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives in unclassified
&gt;form, with classified annexes as necessary.  As of this date (November 29,
&gt;1993), the House and the Senate have agreed to this study, but the
&gt;President has not yet signed the bill.
&gt;
&gt;Assuming the legislation is signed by the President,  this study is
&gt;expected to address the appropriate balance in cryptography policy
&gt;among various national interests (e.g., U.S. economic competitiveness
&gt;(especially with respect to export controls), national security, law
&gt;enforcement, and the protection of the privacy rights of individuals),
&gt;and the strength of various cryptographic technologies known today
&gt;and anticipated in the future that are relevant for commercial
&gt;purposes.  The federal process through which national cryptography
&gt;policy has been formulated is also expected to be a topic of
&gt;consideration, and, if appropriate, the project will address
&gt;recommendations for improving the formulation of national
&gt;cryptographic policy in the future.
&gt;
&gt;This project, like other NRC projects, will depend heavily on input
&gt;from industry, academia, and other communities in the concerned
&gt;public.  Apart from the study committee (described below), briefings
&gt;and consultations from interested parties will be arranged and others
&gt;will be involved as anonymous peer reviewers.
&gt;
&gt;It is expected that the study committee will be a high-level group that
&gt;will command credibility and respect across the range of government,
&gt;academic, commercial, and private interests.  The committee will
&gt;include members with expertise in areas such as:
&gt;
&gt;  - relevant computer and communications technology;
&gt;  - cryptographic technologies and cryptanalysis;
&gt;  - foreign, national security, and intelligence affairs;
&gt;  - law enforcement;
&gt;  - commercial interests; and
&gt;  - privacy and consumer interests.
&gt;
&gt;All committee members (and associated staff) will have to be cleared
&gt;at the "SI/TK" level; provisions have been made to expedite the
&gt;processing of security clearances for those who do not currently have
&gt;them.  Committee members will be chosen for their stature, expertise,
&gt;and seniority in their fields; their willingness to listen and consider
&gt;fairly other points of view; and their ability to contribute to the
&gt;formulation of consensus positions.  The committee as a whole will
&gt;be chosen to reflect the range of judgment and opinion on the subject
&gt;under consideration.
&gt;
&gt;The detailed composition of the committee has not yet been decided;
&gt;suggestions for committee members are sought from the community at
&gt;large.  Note that NRC rules regarding conflict of interest forbid the
&gt;selection as committee members of individuals that have substantial
&gt;personal financial interests that might be significantly affected by the
&gt;outcome of the study.  Please forward suggestions for people to
&gt;participate in this project to CSTB@NAS.EDU by DECEMBER 17,
&gt;1993; please include their institutional affiliations, their field(s) of
&gt;expertise, a note describing how the criteria described above apply to
&gt;them, and a way to contact them.  For our administrative
&gt;convenience, please put in the "SUBJECT:" field of your message the
&gt;words "crypto person".
&gt;
&gt;Finally, some people have expressed concern about the fact that the
&gt;project will involve consideration of classified material.  Arguments
&gt;can and have been made on both sides of this point, but in any event
&gt;this particular ground rule was established by the U.S. Congress, not
&gt;by the CSTB.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the asserted
&gt;need for classification, the task at hand is to do the best possible job
&gt;given this constraint.
&gt;
&gt;On the National Research Council
&gt;
&gt;The National Research Council (NRC) is the operating arm of the
&gt;Academy complex, which includes the National Academy of Sciences,
&gt;the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine.
&gt;The NRC is a source of impartial and independent advice to the
&gt;federal government and other policy makers that is able to bring to
&gt;bear the best scientific and technical talent in the nation to answer
&gt;questions of national significance.  In addition, it often acts as a
&gt;neutral party in convening meetings among multiple stakeholders on
&gt;any given issue, thereby facilitating the generation of consensus on
&gt;controversial issues.
&gt;
&gt;The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the
&gt;NRC considers technical and policy issues pertaining to computer
&gt;science, telecommunications, and associated technologies.  CSTB
&gt;monitors the health of the computer science, computing technology,
&gt;and telecommunications fields, including attention as appropriate to
&gt;the issues of human resources and information infrastructure and
&gt;initiates studies involving computer science, computing technology,
&gt;and telecommunications as critical resources and sources of national
&gt;economic strength.  A list of CSTB publications is available on
&gt;request.
