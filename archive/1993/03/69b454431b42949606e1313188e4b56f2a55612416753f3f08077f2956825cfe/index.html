&gt; In a previous message, I said:  "Just as soon as I know for sure that
&gt; information on this subject [DMS PreMSP] is publicly releasable, I will
&gt; forward it or references to this list."  Here are pointers to the
&gt; currently available public info.
&gt; 
&gt; A Request For Information (RFI) was issued by the Air Force Standard
&gt; Systems Center, Gunter AFB,Al, on December 1992.  (See "Commerce Business
&gt; Daily" for 17 December 1992.)  This RFP concerns X.400 products for use
&gt; in the Defense Message System.  In brief, DOD needs hundreds of thousands
&gt; (of units) of secure UAs over the next several years.
&gt; 
&gt; In the RFI, there is publicly released information concerning Preliminary
&gt; Message Security Protocol (PMSP, or sometimes, PreMSP), which is to be
&gt; used for unclassified by sensitive information.  PMSP is something that
&gt; exists.  Do not expect it to interoperate with PEM.
&gt; 
&gt; Saying "Pre" MSP implies there is a "real" MSP to come later.  There is.
&gt; It comes from NSA's Secure Data Network System Program.  SDNS and MSP
&gt; information is available from NIST, and decriptions are found in the
&gt; proceedings of the National Computer Security Conference and other major
&gt; security conferences in the last few years.  (Perhaps someone will chime
&gt; in again with the NIST references, etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; DMS security developments, including PMSP, will be addressed further by
&gt; an NSA representative at the AFCEA [Armed Forces Communications and
&gt; Electronics Association] DMS Symposium on 8 April.

&gt; 
&gt; 1. As a result of the Allied Message Handling (AMH) International Subject
&gt; Matter Experts (ISME) working group meeting held in March 1991, certain
&gt; actions regarding message security were tasked to the U.S. representatives.
&gt; These tasks include two information papers which address the U.S. intentions
&gt; to use MSP to provide required message security services.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The first of these papers, which addresses the rationale and near-term
&gt; interoperability issues for the use of MSP, is enclosed.  We are forwarding
&gt; this paper to you, as the DMS MCEB Coordinator, for dissemination to the AMH
&gt; ISME membership.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. This paper has also been forwarded to the Chairman, Data Communications
&gt; Protocol Standards (DCPS) Technical Management Panel (DTMP) for use in
&gt; resolving an Interoperability Resolution Process (IRP) issue regarding the DoD
&gt; position on the use of MSP.  Both the AMH ISME and DTMP processes will be
&gt; worked as parallel efforts.

&gt;                        THE DEFENSE MESSAGE SYSTEM (DMS)
&gt;              MESSAGE SECURITY PROTOCOL AND ALLIED INTEROPERABILITY
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Introduction
&gt; 
&gt;     The Defense Message System (DMS) Program has adopted Message Security
&gt; Protocol (MSP) as the target security protection mechanism for all DMS
&gt; organizational and individual message traffic.  MSP was developed under the
&gt; auspices of the Secure Data Network System (SDNS) Program concurrent with
&gt; international development of the CCITT X.400 1988 Recommendation.  SDNS MSP
&gt; and 1988 X.400 offer a similar set of security services.  However, the two
&gt; approaches diverge in certain areas, due to differing priorities and
&gt; requirements, and the operational environment of the U.S. Department of
&gt; Defense (DoD).  The purpose of this paper is to define the principal points of
&gt; departure, provide rationale for U.S. use of MSP, and to provide a framework
&gt; for agreement on near term messaging interoperability.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Rationale for Use of MSP
&gt; 
&gt;     While the security services provided by MSP are similar to the 1988 X.400
&gt; Recommendation, the divergence in their implementation introduces
&gt; incompatibilities between the two strategies.  Following is U.S. rationale for
&gt; use of MSP.
&gt; 
&gt;     2.1  High Level of Assurance:  DMS provides secure automated store-and-
&gt; forward message service to meet the operational requirements of the U.S. DoD.
&gt; The DMS conveys information ranging from unclassified to the most sensitive
&gt; classifications and compartments, requiring very high levels of assurance
&gt; throughout the system.  While few, if any, individual User Agents (UAs) will
&gt; handle this entire range, many will handle more than one, and therefore
&gt; require a high degree of trust.  MSP provides high assurance in the areas of
&gt; implementation strategy, access control, content security, and use of
&gt; commercially available products and services.
&gt; 
&gt;       2.1.1  Implementation Strategy.  To achieve a high level of assurance,
&gt; MSP was designed to provide separation of message security from message
&gt; processing, and to facilitate a certifiable and accreditable implementation.
&gt; By implementing the MSP security services in a separate protocol sub-layer, a
&gt; multi-level secure (MLS) architecture can follow conventional approaches in
&gt; the design of certifiable systems.  The MSP approach depends upon creating a
&gt; small nucleus of "trusted" software, implemented as an adjunct to the UA, that
&gt; interacts with multiple, single-level instantiations of more complex software,
&gt; e.g., text editors and communications protocols.  Further, placing the
&gt; security services at the end system (originator/recipient) is consistent with
&gt; the principle of "least privilege", which requires security processes in a
&gt; system to grant only the most restrictive set of privileges necessary to
&gt; perform authorized tasks.
&gt; 
&gt;                                        1
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;                                                                22 October 1991
&gt; 
&gt;       2.1.2  Access Control.  The approach to access control adopted by MSP
&gt; places access control decisions in a separate process within the originator
&gt; and recipient UAs, providing a higher level of assurance for this service.
&gt; This high level of assurance is supported by detailed security design analyses
&gt; performed on various MSP prototype implementations.
&gt; 
&gt;         2.1.2.1  MSP access control decisions are made as part of message
&gt; preparation and release, and as part of the processing of a received message.
&gt; End system (UA) responsibility for access control is a cornerstone of the MSP
&gt; security architecture.  The access control decision relies on authorization
&gt; information contained in multiple certificates.  These certificates provide
&gt; extended resolution for access control decisions and are further protected by
&gt; cryptography at the UA.  Consequently, no access control message security
&gt; requirements are levied on the Message Transfer Agents (MTAs).
&gt; 
&gt;         2.1.2.2  In contrast, 1988 X.400 access control decisions and
&gt; enforcement are vested in the Message Transfer System (MTS) and are exercised
&gt; independently by the MTAs at each end of the message transfer.  This requires
&gt; that every subscriber uniformly trust all of the MTAs to enforce access
&gt; control for the subscriber community.  A message originator has no independent
&gt; means of determining the access rights of a possible recipient, nor the means
&gt; to determine the level of trust of the MTAs that make access control
&gt; decisions.  He must rely on the correct operation of the MTAs.
&gt; 
&gt;       2.1.3  Content Security.  MSP provides content security and integrity
&gt; services with the implementation of independent cryptographic algorithms and
&gt; key management system at the UA.  Encapsulation of message content with
&gt; appropriate security parameters (e.g., algorithm identification and signature
&gt; information) into a MSP content prior to submitting it to the MTS, ensures
&gt; writer-to-reader control for all security services.  This is true regardless
&gt; of the message transfer system employed.  Since only the originator and
&gt; recipient may access the information, content security is preserved, and the
&gt; means for message confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-
&gt; repudiation with proof of origin is maintained.
&gt; 
&gt;       2.1.4  Commercial Products/Services.  A primary objective of the DMS
&gt; Program is to employ commercially available products and services wherever
&gt; possible, to minimize or eliminate the need for specialized systems.  It is
&gt; also assumed that such products and services will undoubtedly be "untrusted"
&gt; from the security perspective.  The use of MSP allows the DMS to deploy over
&gt; any reliable and heterogeneous MTS and still provide the same level of message
&gt; security and system assurance.  The MSP design and implementation strategy,
&gt; coupled with the incorporated access control and content security mechanisms,
&gt; is consistent with this objective.  While the 1988 X.400 Recommendation offers
&gt; similar services, its employment by DMS would require use of "trusted" MTAs, a
&gt; prospect that is not only cost prohibitive by lacking in deployment
&gt; flexibility.
&gt; 
&gt;                                        2
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;                                                                22 October 1991
&gt; 
&gt;     2.2  Key Management Support.  MSP was designed to be independent of
&gt; cryptographic algorithms and key management schemes.  Although 1988 X.400
&gt; maintains independence of the cryptographic algorithms used, it does employ a
&gt; specific key management scheme as defined in CCITT Recommendation X.509.  The
&gt; protocol mechanisms that realized this key management scheme are incompatible
&gt; with MSP key management.
&gt; 
&gt;       2.2.1  A solution consistent with the MSP concept might be implemented
&gt; within the X.400 syntax, but would represent a semantic inconsistency.  Within
&gt; X.400, no syntax exists to exchange multiple certificates and other per-
&gt; message security data.
&gt; 
&gt;       2.2.2  Even if a certifiable architecture using MSP-like key management
&gt; schemes could be developed to be consistent with 1988 X.400, it would likely
&gt; represent a substantial departure from COTS products.
&gt; 
&gt;     2.3  Performance.  Like MSP, the 1988 X.400 Recommendation defines both
&gt; per-message and per-recipient security data items.  However, the allocation of
&gt; security relevant data, especially the signature and receipt information, is
&gt; different in X.400 and in MSP.  1988 X.400 requires one signature per
&gt; recipient while MSP requires one per message.  The major performance
&gt; implications of this difference are the higher number of signature generation
&gt; operations required by 1988 X.400, and the higher volume of additional data
&gt; carried in each 1988 X.400 message.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Allied Interoperability.
&gt; 
&gt;     3.1  Suggestions from the Allied Message Handling International Subject
&gt; Matter Experts Working Group (AMH ISME WG) recommend that the U.S. incorporate
&gt; MSP mechanisms with the 1988 X.400 framework.  In reviewing this, technical
&gt; difficulties surface as previously discussed, and present a resultant product
&gt; which is semantically non-conformant with the 1988 X.400 Recommendation.  This
&gt; suggestion is unacceptable from a security protection standpoint, and is cost
&gt; prohibitive.
&gt; 
&gt;     3.2  The differences in the MSP and 1988 X.400 security protection
&gt; strategies as described in the rationale serve to illustrate an allied message
&gt; interoperability issue.  It is evident that the U.S. will continue to pursue
&gt; implementation of MSP while U.S. allies, including NATO, appear poised to
&gt; pursue implementations of the 1988 X.400 Recommendation.  When the U.S. begins
&gt; deployment of X.400/MSP components in the 1996 and beyond time frame, a MSP
&gt; gateway will be required to facilitate interoperability between users who have
&gt; implemented X.400 with MSP and users who have not.  A Gateway will be required
&gt; to perform protocol mappings between MSP and X.400-based systems, and to
&gt; provide the required cryptographic and key management conversion services for
&gt; the systems employed.  This Gateway will facilitate U.S. transition to MSP, as
&gt; well as provide interoperability with allied users during the international
&gt; transition to X.400.
&gt; 
&gt;                                        3
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;                                                                22 October 1991
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Conclusions.
&gt; 
&gt;     4.1  Based on the rational provided above, the U.S. concludes that use of
&gt; MSP is superior to 1988 X.400 security protection in terms of assurance, key
&gt; management, performance, deployment flexibility, and cost.
&gt; 
&gt;     4.2  As indicated above, allied interoperability will require an MSP
&gt; Gateway.  The AMH ISME WG is an excellent forum to collect requirements for
&gt; this Gateway to ensure its timely development and deployment, and
&gt; effectiveness in providing near term allied interoperability.  Long term
&gt; interoperability is being analyzed and will be the subject of a 15 February
&gt; 1992 U.S. submission to the AMH ISME WG.

&gt; The Privacy and Security Research Group (PSRG) (i.e., that part of the
&gt; Internet Research Task Force that invented PEM and tossed it over the
&gt; fence into the Internet Engineering Task Force for final standardization
&gt; and deployment)  received inqiries about the position of the U.S.
&gt; Federal Government on the use of Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) (see RFCs
&gt; 1421, 1422, 1423, and 1424).  The PSRG issued a statement which is now
&gt; outdated but was along the following lines:
&gt; 
&gt; The PSRG does not speak for the U.S. Federal Government or for any other
&gt; government.  It can, however, arrange some referrals for those seeking
&gt; Government information.
&gt; 
&gt; Like all bodies operating under the cognizance of the Internet
&gt; Activities Board (IAB), the PSRG is an independent committee of
&gt; professionals with a technical interest in the health and evolution
&gt; of the Internet system (see RFC 1160).  When the PSRG was designing
&gt; and developing PEM, and when the IAB approved and encouraged PEM
&gt; implementation, there was discussion of existing U.S. and other government
&gt; policies and policy trends.  No agreements were reached with any agency
&gt; or official.  Some PSRG members are aware of talks that have taken place
&gt; within the U.S. Government about PEM, but the PSRG is not aware of any
&gt; publicly-announced policies that have been directed specifically at PEM.
&gt; 
&gt; For further information, the PSRG suggests that questions be directed
&gt; to the following PSRG members, who will either answer the question
&gt; or provide a referral to responsible officials:
