                             What is HoHoCon?
                             ----------------

HoHoCon is the largest annual gathering of those in, related to, or
wishing to know more about the computer underground. Attendees generally
include some of the most notable members of the "hacking" and "telecom"
community, journalists, authors, security professionals, lawyers, and a
host of others. Previous speakers include John Draper (Cap'n Crunch), Ray
Kaplan, Chris Goggans (Erik Bloodaxe), Bruce Sterling, and many more. The
conference is also one of the very few that is completely open to the
public and we encourage anyone who is interested to attend.


                            Hotel Information
                            -----------------

The Austin North Hilton recently split its complex into two seperate
hotels; the Hilton and the newly added Super 8. HoHoCon guests have the
choice of staying in either hotel. Group rates are as followed :

Super 8: Single - $46.50, Double - $49.50, Triple - $52.50, Quad - $55.50
Hilton : Single - $69.00, Double - $79.00, Triple - $89.00, Quad - $99.00

Once again, the hotel has set aside a block of rooms for the conference
and we recommend making your reservations as early as possible to
guarantee a room within the block, if not to just guarantee a room period.
Rooms for the handicapped are available upon request. To make your
reservations, call the the number listed above that corresponds with where
you are and where you want to stay and make sure you tell them you are

away. The hotel accepts American Express, Visa, Master Card, Discover,
Diner's Club, and Carte Blanche credit cards.

order for the hotel to hold a room past 6:00 p.m. on the date of arrival,
the individual reservation must be secured by a deposit or guaranteed
with one of the credit cards listed above. Also, any cancellations of
guaranteed reservations must be made prior to 6:00 p.m. on the date of
arrival. You will be responsible for full payment of any guaranteed
reservations which are not cancelled by this time.

The hotel provides transportaton to and from the airport and will give
you full information when you make your reservations.

       This conference sucks



A (*) denotes that these speakers are not 100% confirmed as of yet, but
there is a very good chance they will be speaking. There will also be more 
speakers added during the conference. We are still taking submissions, so
if you would like to speak during the conference, please mail us as soon
as possible and include a brief outline of what you would like to speak 
on and a rough estimate of how long you will need. 

We would like to have people bring interesting items and videos again this
year. If you have anything you think people would enjoy having the chance
to see, please let us know ahead of time, and tell us if you will need any
help getting it to the conference. If all else fails, just bring it to the
con and give it to us when you arrive. Any organization or individual that
wants to bring flyers to distribute during the conference may do so. You
may also send your flyers to us ahead of time if you can not make it to
the conference and we will distribute them for you. Left over flyers are
included with information packets and orders that we send out, so if you
want to send extras, go ahead.


                                   Cost
                                   ----

Unlike smaller, less informative conferences, we do not ask you to shell
out hundreds of dollars just to get in the door, nor do we take your money
and then make you sleep in a tent. We are maintaining the motto of "give
$5 if you can", but due to the incredibly high conference room rate this
year, we may step up to "$5 minimum required donation" or "give us $5 or
we'll smash your head in". Five dollars is an outrageously low price
compared to the suit infested industry conferences or even the new "Cons
are k00l and trendy, I gotta do one too!" conferences that are charging
up to $50 for admission alone.

To encourage people to donate, we will once again be having our wonderless
"Raffle For The Elite" during the conference.  


                           Miscellaneous Notes
                           -------------------

Video cameras will *NOT* be allowed inside the conference room, except
for the people who have received prior consent to film. Still photos 
are fine as each speaker will announce whether he or she minds them
being taken.

The minimum required donation is $5. This basically means that there is
a definite cover charge this year. Everyone who attends will receive one
raffle ticket with more available for an additional cost. Anyone who 
whines about the door cost will be severly beaten with a bat.

Raffle prizes include two computer systems (one is a brand new Packard
Bell 486 and the other is a complete package with monitor and printer),
one flip phone and one brick phone, an autographed copy of Guy Kawasaki's 
"Computer Curmudgeon", "Terminal Compromise" by Winn Schwartau, 6 tapes
(36 hours) of poorly edited cheesy hotel porn, an autographed 'Dazed &amp;
Confused' velvet black-light poster, subscriptions to major and not so
major computer/telecommunications magazines, assorted t-shirts and 
videos, and numerous other items including those we don't know of yet.
Although nobody will ever believe this until they see it, one of the 
major prizes this year is a 4x4 Jeep used by Brandon and Brenda Walsh
(Jason Priestly and Shannen Dougherty) of Beverly Hills 90210. Yes, 
ladies and gentlemen, we are giving away a BRAND NEW CAR.

The starting time of the conference has changed from 11:00 a.m. to 
10:00 a.m.  Keep this in mind when pondering whether or not to down yet
another bottle of Wild Turkey or Mad Dog 20/20 on Friday night.

HoHoCon '93 shirts, as well as last year's video and a new version of the
I Love Feds shirt, will be available during the conference. The shirts
are $15 and the video is $20. We have also added XXL for all you big 
folks. If you are unable to attend the conference and wish to obtain 
any of these items, you may either mail us for more information or 
send a check or money order payable to O.I.S. to the address listed
below. Include $3 per order (not per item) for shipping.

For those who have been asking, I do not expect it to be too cold
during the conference. The weather has been fairly nice as of late.

Due to a major hard disk crash, Metalland Southwest (the HoHoCon BBS) is
down until further notice. Please mail us if you would like information

There will be a small, all female S&amp;M/Bondage presentation on Saturday
night in one of the hospitality suites. Please bring numerous one dollar 
bills. Also, keep this in mind when considering purchasing the HoHoCon 93
video.

Peter Shipley and John Draper have expressed interest in exchanging PGP
keys with other attendess this year. If you wish to partake in this 
activity, bring your key along with you, preferably on a IBM/MS-DOS 
floppy. 

Those of you driving from Houston that wish to join to HoHoConvoy which
leaves for Austin on Friday morning should call the HoHoCon VMB and 
leave a message with a contact number.

By attending the conference, you are consenting to being filmed and
photographed and having your ugly likeness used in any fashion I deem
appropriate.

The HoHoCon sluggo mail address has changed slightly. Due to mail
constantly being delivered to the wrong box or being returned because 
slight addressing mistakes, the box number has been removed and an 
attention line added. If you have had problems mailing us recently,
try again with the new address listed below.

                                77008-4106


We also have a VMB which includes all the conference information and is
probably the fastest way to get updated reports. The number is:

                               713-867-9544

Those of you with net access can ftp to cypher.com and find all the
HoHoCon information available in /pub/hohocon. The .gifs from previous
cons are *not* currently online.

                                                                         
     Same stupid ending statement from last year to make us look good
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

HoHoCon '93 will be a priceless learning experience for professionals and
gives journalists a chance to gather information and ideas direct from the
source. It is also one of the very few times when all the members of the
computer underground can come together for a realistic purpose. We urge
people not to miss out on an event of this caliber, which doesn't happen
very often. If you've ever wanted to meet some of the most famous people
from the hacking community, this may be your one and only chance. Don't
wait to read about it in all the magazines and then wish you had been
there, make your plans to attend now! Be a part of what we hope to be our
largest and greatest conference ever.
