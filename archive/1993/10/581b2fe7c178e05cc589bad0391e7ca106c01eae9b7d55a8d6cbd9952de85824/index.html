I've looked at Matthew Ghio's encryption technique and have some
comments.  First let me summarize the system.

private key: a sequence of polynomial functions f_1, f_2 ... f_n of the
  form a_i x (x+1)/2 + b_i, where a_i is odd.

public key: the composition of these functions f(x) = f_1 ( f_2 ( ... f_n(x)))
  and a modulus P = 2^k

plaintext: a value 't'

ciphertext: the value u = f(t)

decryption: finding t such that f(t)=u, by using of the f_i


Matthew has repeatedly claimed that it can't be broken.  Now one of
the first rules of cipher design is don't claim that unless you have
some good reason to believe that it can't be broken.  Merely saying "I
can't figure out how" is NOT sufficient.  No flame intended, Matthew,
this is probably the single most common failing of people interested
in crypto.

In particular, Matthew has made the claim that one must find the
coefficients of the f_i in order to decrypt and claims that finding
such coefficients is difficult.  He calls this operation factoring;
properly speaking this is a 'decomposition', since the operation used
to make f(x) is not multiplication by composition (called iteration
when all the functions are the same).

As I suspected and Karl has demonstrated, these decompositions are not
unique.  Since the plaintext, ciphertext pair does not depend on the
representation of the function, only upon the coefficients of the
polynomial function which is the public key, any such decomposition
will suffice for decryption.  In other words, you don't have to find
how the function was created in order to decode.  All you need is some
way of inverting the polynomial function f(x).

Note that I am using the phrase polynomial function here, and not just
the word polynomial.  There is a big difference.  Polynomial functions
are real functions with a domain and range.  Polynomials are elements
of a ring created by adjoining an indeterminate 'x' to some ring.
Polynomials can be 'evaluated' as polynomial functions under some
circumstances, but not always.

A side note.  The function Matthew picks, 1/2 x(x+1) is not, properly
speaking, a function with coefficients in Z/2^k (integers mod 2^k).
It is, however, a coefficient in Z/2^{k+1}

There's one significant difference for the purposes of this proposed
cipher: polynomials have arbitrarily large degree, but every
polynomial function over a finite ring (such as integers mod N) is
equal to some polynomial function of finite degree.  One can see this
easily be recalling Fermat's little theorem a^N == a (mod N).  Thus
x^N == x (mod N) for polynomial functions, which limits the degree.

Matthew has proposed that arbitrarily many compositions will give a
function which can't be inverted.  This is certainly not the case if N
= 2^k as he proposes.  The following relation holds for all integers
n &gt; 0 and for all integers t:

	2^{2^n - 1} | \Product_{i=0}^{2^n - 1} ( t + i )

What this means is that as the 2^k grows larger, the maximum degree of
the polynomial functions grows as 'k', not as 2^k.  In other words,
the degree grows as the logarithm of the modulus, or linearly in the
number of bits in the modulus, if you prefer.  This is certainly not a
good sign.

Recommendation: don't use N=2^k.

It's a general rule of cryptosystems that if you use 2^k moduli to
speed your encryption, you will also speed the attack, and not just
from increased speed, but from algebraic properties of these moduli.
There have been some spectacular failures in this regard, notably a
chip which was built to do modular exponention for a particular 2^k
which was later found to be totally insecure.

Another property which decreases the security of the scheme is that
polynomials over Z/2^k don't have unique factorization.  Therefore the
polynomial functions don't have unique representations.  For example

	(x+1)(x+3) = (x+5)(x+7) (mod 8)
	(x+2)(x+4) = x (x+6) (mod 8)
	x (x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = 0 (mod 8) (from the expression above)

This makes it all the easier to invert the polynomial.  The reason
that you don't have unique factorization is that Z/2^k has zero
divisors: 2 x 4 = 0 (mod 8), so two divides zero.  The presence of
zero divisors means that you don't get unique factorization.

There is, however, a twist.  If you don't even see the zero-divisors,
you can pretend they aren't there.  This is exactly what RSA does,
since if you find a multiple of one of the factors of the modulus,
you've broken the system.

But if you use a modulus of the form pq, you're basically using RSA!
RSA picks a particularly easy polynomial function to invert, namely
f(x) = x^e.  Other polynomials would work as well, and, in fact,
appear in the patent application, albeit without examples.

Now if you pick a prime modulus, you don't have a public key system
anymore.  This is the Hellman-Pohlig patent, which uses x^e (mod p) as
its encryption.  In this scheme 'p' is kept secret, since otherwise
the exponentiation could be reversed.

In short, I don't think Matthew's scheme can be made to work.  There
is an open question about how the base field increases with each
composition because of the presence of the 1/2, but I don't think
currently that this makes it work.

For a specific reference, see the collection _Cryptology and
Computational Number Theory_ which contains an essay by Kevin McCurley
"Odds and Ends from Computational Number Theory."  Section 3 of this
essay discusses the breaking of some similar schemes by some
non-obvious means.  I quote: "Moreover, it holds a valuable lesson for
those who tend to believe that a computational problem is difficult
just because the only apparent solution is difficult."
