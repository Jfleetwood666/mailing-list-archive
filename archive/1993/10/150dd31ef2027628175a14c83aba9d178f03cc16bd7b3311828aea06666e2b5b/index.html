This might be interesting, though international, to many of you.  Seems a
certain Internet node is perceived as vital to the Georgians in their
struggles.

    Hi,
    Speaking of fronteers and freedom, here is a need for communications
    equiptment for which I have been unable to get any direct help. Any
    chance of posting this on the EFF? 
    Good Wishes,

    Attn: Senator Stevens
             Anna Kerttula
             Anna KerttulaUs replacement
    
    Dear Senator Stevens,
    
    It is appalling what goes on in Georgia. It is a chaos of crime and needs
    direct attention now. Is there nothing that the US can do? Cannot Russia
    control her own boarders and disallow weapons and soldiers to assist in the
    murder of Georgians? How can we loan money to the Russians while this
    continues? And where is the United Nations during this critical time? I am
    faxing you the latest and perhaps the last information from the office of Mr.
    Shevardnadze and his assistant, Dr. Gomelauri. They need medical help,
    communications help, but mostly, UN peace keeping forcer and Russia to keep
    her word on helping to keep the peace. I realize the Russians have had their
    own problems this past week but that does not excuse them for their lack of
    help and allowing of arms and soldiers to attack the Georgians. Please read
    these two short letters I just received via email. Please pass them on to Dr.
    Butros-Ghali of the UN as I have neither his fax number or email address. 
    
    I am very actively searching for grants relative to the communications needs
    of Georgia and as soon as I can find one I will apply and notify you of the
    same. Is there a way to get equipment for a node over there now? You will see
    that they need the freedom to communicate. Dr. Gomelauri of the Georgian
    Academy of Sciences working in conjunction with Mr. Shevardnadze would be the
    first level of priority to receive such equipment. If I can be of any
    assistance, please call on me. 
    
    To sum up this letter:
    1) Georgia needs peace keeping enforcement now.
    2) Georgian needs humanitarian relief now
    3) Georgia needs independent communication abilities now
    4) Georgia needs American friendship
    
    Thank you,
    
    
    Joe Davis

    Dear Paul,
    
    Thanks to you and all who are trying to support democratically-
    oriented forces in Georgia and personally Mr. Shevardnadze.
    Every day the situation is more and more tragic in Georgia. Our entrance in
    the Mow. computer node (the only canal to the Internet)
    is practically closed. I received your mail after 3 days you send it to me.
    
    WE NEED DIRECT ENTRANCE IN TO THE INTERNET to give the possibility
    our users including Brian to send you information from here promptly.
    
    The port POTI was occupied earlier few days ago by Kobalia supported
    by killers, Kazak and North-Caucasus Russian citizens.
    So Georgia can not be reached from the Black Sea. That means hunger
    will start fast.
    Separatist forces continued to move to the east.
    Pleas try to explain to ISF it is vital for Georgia TODAY to keep the
    node GGOM@CIT.GE in operation. My proposal about the Support and
    Renovation today is vital not only for the Academy but whole country.
    Big plans for future with many VAXes may not be needed if Georgia does
    not exist at all. To my Proposal satellite line must be added because
    as I see the dish of Georgian Foundation will not arrive this year. 
    Please try to find someone who will donate CIT few mobile laptops
    (second hand PC/XT compatible) with modems, satellite canal and
    necessary hardware + software. You know we will put it in operation in
    few hours. This is tremendously important. We can not reach Moscow node few
    days so I am afraid you will get my mail too late if ever. Here is very
    important information from the Head of the State for the posting worldwide on
    the networks. Please continue to do this.

    Subject:  Tragedy in Svaneti - Georgian Caucasus
    From:     ggom@coira.kheta.georgia.su
    
                  D E C L A R A T I O N
    
         On September 16, 1993 the Gudauta side once again violated the July 27
    Sochi cease-fire agreement and began a large-scale assault upon the city of
    Sukhumi. Disarmed pursuant to the above agreement the defenders of Sukhumi
    after selflessly fighting a fierce battle left the city along with the tens of
    thousands of civilians. However, the Gudauta separatists were not content with
    this and continued hostilities in the direction of Ochamchira and Gali. The
    only safe area where the refugees could hide themselves from the barbaric
    atrocities, perpetrated by the mercenaries hired by the Gudauta side, was the
    mountainous region of Svaneti. Therefore, over one hundred thousand refugees
    among whom the overwhelming majority are women, children and old people are
    currently seeking shelter in the mountains.
    
         This created a very difficult situation in Svaneti. It has been snowing
    for some time now.
         Dozens of people have already died of hunger and cold, and what is
    particularly tragic there are infants among the dead. The Georgian leadership
    is taking all possible
    measures to help people. Food and warm clothes as well as various conveyances
    to bring the refugees out of Svaneti are being sent there. This, however, is
    not enough. The acute economic crisis raging in Georgia makes it impossible to
    use every means to save those in trouble. Unless immediate decisive measures
    are taken, the current disastrous situation will turn tragic. The overall
    situation is being seriously aggravated by the supporters of the ex-president,
    who have cut off the major communication arteries.
    
         Considering the present situation Svaneti shall be declared the zone of
    distress. I request all the neighboring countries, the people of good will -
    to empathize with the Georgians in trouble. Do not let tens of thousands of
    children, women, old men die of hunger and cold. The quickest and the most
    convenient way to bring them out is by helicopters. However, Georgia has only
    a few. We are also in dire need of warm clothes, foodstuffs and medications.
    
         I want you to know that Georgia expects and believes that you will help
    promptly. The delay is tantamount to death.
    
         May God bless you.
    
                                    Eduard Shevardnadze.
