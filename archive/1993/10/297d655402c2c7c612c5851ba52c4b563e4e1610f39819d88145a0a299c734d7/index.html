As part of class project here at Ga. Tech, we are designing/implementing a new
(graphical) interface for the program PGP, Pretty Good Privacy. 

To do this well, we need information about the potential user community of
such an interface, and the pros/cons of the existing PGP interface...
thus we are sending out this questions

As mentioned in the survey, the data collected will be kept confidential,
and we encourage the replies to this survey to be sent via anonymous
remailers.

9.  Encryption is a common method of protecting information
transmitted.  The basic mechanism works as follows: 
              
         The information or message (text) is encoded from its initial
         readable form, to an internal form by means of a 'key'.  This
         internal text form (ciphertext), although readable, does not
         make any sense.  To make sense of the cipher text, the
         receiver must decode it (with a 'key') back into its initial
         readable form. If the encoded information is accessed by an
         unauthorized person, it will be useless unless it can be
         decoded (i.e. a person has a 'key' for it).
              
                                                Yes     No
    9A. Are you familiar with this concept?
                                                ---     ---
    
    9B. Have you ever used encryption?
                                                ---     ---
         
    9C. Have you ever encrypted files or mail?
                                                ---     ---
