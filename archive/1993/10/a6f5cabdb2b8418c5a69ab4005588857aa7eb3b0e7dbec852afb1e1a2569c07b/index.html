I've thought about this a lot.  Right now, there's an international (very
low speed) sort-of internet based in Amateur Packet Radio.  Everyone has a
2meter FM (range 5-10 miles over flat turrain; up to 300 to a tall mountain
through a repeater) handi-talky on their belts and a 1200 (a little 2400)
*half duplex* modem with which they check into whatever bbs is near by and
get their mail from all over the world.  There are 19.2 &amp; I think 56kpbs
backbones operating over satelittes &amp; High Frequency.  It works.  It's
intolerably slow.  It's operating legally on ham frequencies which do not
(legally) allow encryption.

The main reason it's so slow is that the protocal was designed by these
guys in Phoenix 10 years ago to use the radios popularly off the shelf
then.

Now, however, there are *FULL DUPLEX* radios available cheap ($400) off the
shelf that use separate bands for tx &amp; rx to make them cheap.  (Most of
these are 144 MHz &lt;-&gt; 440 MHz, Transmit on one, receive on the other,
either way)

I'm working on a new protocal which instead of using the current CSMA/CD,
has local repeaters serving an area which do full duplex &amp; pass a token
around.  Unfortunately, I'll probably only be able to increase bandwidth
enough to bring the current 4-5 users per frequency up to 15 or 20.  This
is still nowhere near enough to do what you want, but it does still use
off-the-shelf radios &amp; modems you can build for $20 in parts &amp; connect to
your PC or Mac (Software will also be req'd- mods to current stuff will
work)

My roomate, tvr@cnmat.CNMAT.Berkeley.EDU (KD6PAG), is working on custome
radios that raise that 2400 bps barrier to 19.2 or 38kpbs.  I think that
without my full duplex protocal, he'll still have to wait around dealing
with transmit-receive turnover latency, but hey- if it works, wow!

Anyone else with any cool ideas?

I wish to announce my recent aquisition of some databases which are
primarily used by skip-tracing, investigative and government agencies
to locate people, any assets they may have, and other pertinent and
personal details of their lives.

These databases are being made available to anyone who wishes to have
access to them. The charges are simply being passed along, 'at cost'
based on what I am paying. 

First, a description of what is available and the cost for access.
Then, information on how to obtain the information you want.

SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TRACING:
===============================

You provide an SSN. I will advise you of all the names which have
been used with this SSN, and the addresses which go with each. Or
it can be the other way around: you supply an exact name and address
(it can sometimes be a former address), and I will supply you with
the SSN used by that person.

      Cost for each lookup, either direction is $60.00

PEOPLE FINDER:
==============

You provide a name. Any name okay, but very common names will
render a useless list. Middle initials and last known address is
requested if possible.  You'll receive a listing of every person who
has that name, along with other data:

     New address if they moved;
     Telephone number provided the number is published;
     Residence type;
     Length of residence;
     Gender;
     Date of birth;
     Up to four other household members and their dates of birth.

For additional information, People Finder also can provide a neighbor
listing which includes up to ten neighbors, their addresses, phone
numbers and residence types. 

The People Finder database has 120 million names, 80 million house-
holds and 61 million telephone numbers. 

It can be searched by telephone number only: You provide the phone
number, I will respond with the person's profile and neighbor listing.
Ot it can be searched by address only, with the same results.

      Cost for each lookup is based on how extensive the search
      is. 
                Within a single state only,   $80
                Checking two or three states, $95
                Checking nationwide,          $120

                Address or phone trace,       $50  (either one)
                Both address/phone trace      $90

People Finder comes with a guarentee: if I cannot produce at least
one person with the name you request plus an address for that
person, then there is no charge.

CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTS:
========================

Consumer Credit reports availale from one bureau,     $60
Consumer Credit reports available from three bureaus, $100

I need two things:

  1. The name and address of the person, plus SSN if possible.
  2. A *signed* statement that your request is for bonafide,
     legal reasons, i.e. you are considering an extension of
     credit to the person, or possibly employing them, etc. I
     cannot proceed without this signed statement.

OTHER DATABASE FEATURES:
========================

Has someone ever filed bankruptcy?  The database will tell you
if they have or not. Not all federal districts are yet installed
but for those that are in the database, I can get you the details:
                            
                                 Any one district               $40
                                 Checking all districts avail.  $160

Commercial Credit reports available on any business in file,    $95
About fourteen million businesses and corporations included.

Criminal History records available at $75-100 per jurisdiction you
request searched. 
      Want to know if someone has ever been in prison?
      Want to know if someone has ever been sued, or been a
        defendant in a criminal action?

      I need the exact name, SSN and DOB  of the person. (If needed,
      get the SSN and DOB by using the lookups mentioned earlier.)
      If you have a good idea *where* such action or incarceration
      may have taken place, it will greatly reduce your costs in
      using this database. 

Death Records can be provided in various formats:

      By SSN only - is the holder of that SSN deceased or not?  $30
      By name - a more detailed account of their demise         $40

Drivers Records can be pulled but the exact name and DOB
is essential; otherwise if you have the full driver's license
number, the search can be reversed, providing a name and DOB
plus address. (Then use People Finder address trace on them.)   $65

Education and degree verification is possible, and frequently
used to expose those people who are not what they claim to be.  $35

Real Property Asset Locator database                            $75
I can do this, but need to know *which* areas to search. With
this information, you know whether or not it is advisable to
sue someone 'for everything he has got' or not.

Who is the real owner of the corporation with which you are
having a dispute?  The name(s) and address(es) of the officers
of corporations are available in many places. Sometimes you
get their home address and phone number in the process.         

           If you know what state the corporation is based in   $45
           If you wish to have a search of 30 states done       $165

Would you like to know if soeone is getting workers comp money?
           
            If you know what state they are likely to get it
            from, I can verify it  (only in selected areas)     $63


Uniform Commercial Code filings by state                        $52

VIN (vehicle identification numbers) checked by state           $50

               ==================================

Now those are the basic items available in the databases. There are
other features and further, more detailed searches can be done at
the rate of $100 per hour. 

Some caveats:

You have to pay for the lookup whether or not it is successful
because *I* have to pay each time I access the databases. The better
the information you provide to start with, the more likely you will
get positive results.  The exception is 'People Finder'. If I cannot
provide you with *at least one name* which matches your request or
*at least one person* at the specified address or phone number,
then there is no charge. 'People Finder' may or may not include
unlisted/non-pub phone numbers. Don't count on it. It won't work
with PO Box addresses.

Regards SSN Trace, it does not work well if the person to whom the
number is issued is less than 21-22 years of age. The number has to
be circulating for a year or so in order for it to make its way into
the database. Meaning, a person has to have credit, have entered into
various agreements, etc ... and they may have done this as early as
age 18, but best results are obtained on these traces if the person
is at least a few years older.

On the Drivers Records checks, CA only lists names without addresses
and MA/GA are difficult to work with. 

If you want a credit bureau report on someone, I repeat: you must
send a signed statement (by fax is okay) stating that you have a 
bonafide, legal reason for this information. Spouses are *not*
legally entitled to the credit bureau file of their 'other half'
without permission. 

                      ==================

How to obtain the information you want:

Payment can be by credit card, electronic funds transfer from 
your USA bank account, or check sent with your inquiry. If you 
pay by credit card or EFT, then transactions can be handled by phone
or fax entirely. With your request, include your VISA/MC number,
the name on the account, and date of expiration. Or, include the
name of your bank, the exact name on the checking account, and
*all* the numbers across the bottom of your check. 

Telephone: 312-465-0707   or Fax: 312-743-0002

Generally, your search results will be returned to you within 24-36
hours under most conditions.

If you prefer to send a letter, you can include your check or
relevant credit card information in the letter addressed to:

      ------------------------------------------------------
Information should be available to everyone, not just the lawyers
and bankers and government agencies. I'll provide information to
anyone, at anytime from the categories above. Hope to hear from
you soon with your requests.

Here's to successful snooping! Get the goods on your friends and
enemies alike. An imposter/fraud/con-artist on the net? Expose them
in a detailed message with stuff you get from the database.
