<span class="n">Late</span> <span class="n">last</span> <span class="n">month</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">much</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">satisfaction</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">sheriff</span><span class="s1">'s deputies in
Sacramento County, California, William Steen began serving 68 months in
prison for trafficking in child pornography over computers and then
attempting to hire a man to kill one of the teenagers who had testified
against him. Detectives who worked on the case say the sentence
represents an almost entirely gratifying end to the two-year-old effort
to track down and convict Steen.

The prosecution was not quite perfect, though. Police were unable to
nail any of Steen'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">network</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">child</span> <span class="n">porn</span> <span class="n">associates</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">which</span> <span class="n">officials</span>

<span class="n">Steen</span><span class="s1">'s computer diary, which police think may contain the names of his
other teenage victims.

The reason is that Steen, of Santa Clara, California, had installed a
powerful code on his computer to electronically scramble what he had
written.  Although experts were quickly able to determine the name of
the encoding program-- called Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP-- efforts to
break it failed miserably.  "The task was given to us to decrypt this
stuff," recalls William Sternow, a California computer-crime expert
called in on the case. "And to this day we have not been able to do it."

Sternow and the other experts-- including the Los Angeles Police
Department, which tired to dismantle PGP as well-- probably shouldn'</span><span class="n">t</span>
<span class="n">hold</span> <span class="n">their</span> <span class="n">breaths</span> <span class="n">waiting</span> <span class="n">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">breakthrough</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">It</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">unlikely</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">they</span>
<span class="n">will</span> <span class="n">crack</span> <span class="n">Steen</span><span class="s1">'s diaries anytime soon, probably not in their
lifetimes.

Forget your cereal-box decoder rings. Pretty Good Privacy, a computer
program designed by a short, slightly round Boulder programmer named
Philip Zimmermann, is, as far as the current technology is concerned,
about as accessible as Fort Knox.

While PGP has frustrated the California cops, it has done wonders for
its inventor'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">reputation</span> <span class="n">among</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">thriving</span> <span class="n">underground</span> <span class="n">network</span> <span class="k">of</span>

What Phil Zimmermann deserves more than anything this gray morning is a
few more hours of sleep. "I was up until four this morning working on
the computer," he grumbles with not-very-well-disguised irritation.
"Give me 45 minutes to become human."

One hour later, this is what Phil Zimmermann looks like, human: a short
guy, a little paunchy. He wears large aviator glasses, a heavy beard and
an easy elfin grin. Today he is also wearing beige pants, a green shirt,
and blue Etonic sneakers. Although separately none of the parts looks
askew, for some reason the package still looks rumpled.

His living room feels small and is crammed with books, a respectable
percentage of which are bona fide, Noam Chomsky-certified leftist
tracts.  The back room of the north Boulder house serves as Zimmermann'</span><span class="n">s</span>

mailbox and computer since June 1991, when PGP was first published.

Now Plumb is here for two weeks as a volunteer assistant, helping
Zimmermann update Pretty Good Privacy. He is not the first admirer to
make the hajj to Boulder. "I get people here all the time," says
Zimmermann. "A month ago I got a visit from a guy from Brazil. He used
PGP back in Rio de Janeiro, and he was touring the country and he wanted
to meet the guy who invented it."

Zimmermann continues: "I get mail from people in the Eastern Bloc saying

<span class="k">break</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"

For Zimmermann, who is 39 years old, writing and breaking codes had
always been just a hobby, albeit an increasingly intensive one. Up until
1976, that is, when his hobby became an obsession that would absorb the
next fifteen years of his life. That's because, like everyone else who
had been dabbling in encryption at the time, Phil Zimmermann was swept
away by the revolutionary concept of public-key cryptography and the RSA
algorithms.

===

Secret codes have been used for thousands of years, but they have always
operated on the same principle: The words or letters of the message to
be encoded-- called the "</span><span class="n">plaintext</span><span class="s2">"-- are replaced by other words,
letters, numbers and symbols. These are then shuffled, rendering the
communication incomprehensible.

As spies and other secretive sorts began to use computers, the basic
idea remained the same. But the substitution and shuffling became
increasingly complex. (Just how complex is difficult to grasp. This
summer a panel of experts met to evaluate the NSA's most recent
encryption system. They concluded that it would take a Cray
supercomputer 400 billion years of continuous operation to exhaust all
the possible substitutions.)

Yet even with the most scrambled substitutions, encryption always
suffered from a glaring weakness: A code is only as secure as the
channel over which it travels. What this has meant practically is that
messages-- whether flown by pigeon or broadcast over a shortwave-- could
always be intercepted by the enemy.

This was particularly dangerous when it came time to share the code's
"</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"  Traditionally, codes were always encrypted by a key that would
garble, say, plain English into unreadable gobbledygook. The encoded
message would then be sent to the recipient, who would use the same key
to translate the message back into English.

The problem with this, of course, is: How do you get the key from one
place to another without danger of its being intercepted? After all,
once a key is swiped by the bad guys, the entire code is rendered
useless. Worse yet, what if you had no idea the key had been stolen, and
your enemies continued to freely read messages you thought were
protected? This is especially troublesome when you're trying to
maintain a large network of secret sharers.

Surprisingly, this ancient glitch was not cleared up until the spring of
1975. That's when a Stanford computer junkie named Whitfield Diffie
created a crypto-revolution called public-key cryptology, a system
simple in theory-- but complicated in practice-- that effectively solved
the problem of key sharing.

What Diffie did was imagine a system with two mathematically related
keys, one public and one private. The public key could be as public as a
published address. The private key would not be shared with anyone.  The
connection was that a message encoded with one key could be decoded by
the other. 

To understand how this works, imagine the keys as public and private
telephone numbers. The sender garbles a message with the receiver's
public key, obtained from the computer equivalent of a phone book. Once
sent, the only way the message can be decoded is with the receiver's
mathematically related private key.

Since each receiver has his own private key, no one has to share keys,
and there is no danger of having the solution to the code intercepted.
Equally important, each encoded message could bear the unique signature
of its sender. (The sender encodes the message with his private key. The
receiver affirms the message's authenticity by using the sender's
mathematically related public key to unscramble the communication.) This
eliminates the potential for some meddling third part to send a false
message.

Diffie's idea of two keys instead of one ignited a bomb among the
burgeoning community of computer hackers and academic math types, who
immediately began toying with public-key encryption. Not surprisingly,
it didn't take long for the theory to be applied to real-life
codemaking.

In 1977 three MIT scientists named Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard
Adelman constructed a series of algorithms, or mathematical
instructions, that put Diffie's idea into practice. The three men named
their public-key encryption system RSA, after their initials. They
patented the algorithms and formed a company, RSA Data Security.

Today the company practically enjoys a monopoly on public-key
encryption. It puts out an eye-catching advertising pamphlet ("</span><span class="n">RSA</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="n">BEcause</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">things</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="n">better</span> <span class="n">left</span> <span class="n">unread</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">" and sells millions of
dollars' worth of encoding packages (one example: BSAFE 2.0).

RSA's president is D. James Bidzos. He is not lining up to buy lunch for
Phil Zimmermann. In fact, he claims that Zimmermann is little more than
a poseur whose only real contribution to cryptology was to swipe RSA's
technology.

Phil Zimmermann says that while he became fascinated with public-key
encryption in the mid-1970s, he didn't begin seriously contemplating
designing a useful application until 1984, when he was researching an
article about the subject for a technical magazine. In 1986 he began
fiddling with the RSA algorithms-- what he describes as "</span><span class="n">RSA</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">petri</span>

<span class="n">downloaded</span> <span class="n">PGP</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">began</span> <span class="n">using</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">encrypt</span> <span class="n">their</span> <span class="n">own</span> <span class="n">messages</span><span class="p">.</span>

<span class="n">Although</span> <span class="n">PGP</span> <span class="n">didn</span><span class="s1">'t contribute a lot to the theory of encryption, it did
make cryptology usable and available to the average computer jock, says
David Banisar, an analyst for the nonprofit Computer Professionals for
Social REsponsibility in Washington, D.C. "Phil didn'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">invent</span> <span class="n">the</span>
<span class="n">engine</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" he says, "</span><span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">he</span> <span class="n">did</span> <span class="n">fit</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">inside</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">Ford</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"

Indeed, the father of public-key cryptology himself says Zimmermann's
proletarian privacy program is the closest thing yet to what he had in
mind when he invented public-key encryption nearly two decades ago-- a
nongovernment encoding system that would give the average computer user
the means to communicate without fear.

"</span><span class="n">PGP</span> <span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">done</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">good</span> <span class="n">deal</span> <span class="n">for</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">practice</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">cryptology</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" says
Whitfield Diffie, who now works for Sun Microsystems near San Francisco.
"</span><span class="n">It</span><span class="s1">'s close to my heart because it'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">close</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">my</span> <span class="n">original</span> <span class="n">objectives</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"

In perhaps the greatest testimony to Zimmermann's program, even those
who condemn the programmer for irresponsibly releasing PGP continue to
use his software. "</span><span class="n">It</span><span class="s1">'s a great program," concedes Sacramento computer
expert Sternow. "We recommend in our training to cops that they use it
to encrypt their stuff." Sternow estimates that more than 500 law
enforcement officers currently use PGP.

PGP also spurred a loose-knit California-based group of computer users
with a passion for cryptology to form a new organization to carry the
torch. The group, whose members call themselves the Cypherpunks,
espouses an unabashed libertarian philosophy when it comes to electronic
privacy-- specifically, that privacy is far too crucial a civil right
to be left to the governments of the world, and that the best way to
head off government control of cryptology is to spread the capability to
shroud messages to everyone.

"Phil showed that an ordinary guy just reading the papers that already
existed could put together an encryption system that the Nation Security
Agency could break," says John Gilmore, one of three founders o the
Silicon Valley-based Cypherpunks. "It took a certain amount of bravery
to put this out, because at the time the government was talking about
restrictions on cryptography."

James Bidzos failed to see Zimmermann'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">courage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">however</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="k">In</span> <span class="n">fact</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">all</span>
<span class="n">he</span> <span class="n">saw</span> <span class="n">was</span> <span class="n">theft</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="n">concluding</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">Pretty</span> <span class="n">Good</span> <span class="n">Privacy</span> <span class="n">was</span> <span class="n">based</span> <span class="n">on</span>
<span class="n">RSA</span><span class="s1">'s patented algorithms, he placed a call to Boulder. Basically," he
recalls, "we said, '</span><span class="n">What</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">fuck</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="s1">' "

Bidzos also contends that Zimmermann hardly wrote the program out of
altruism, even through Pretty Good Privacy is technically free.  "The
documentation he distributes with PGP is misleading," he says. "It does
give the impression that Zimmermann is a hero hell-bent on saving you
from the evil government and an evil corporation. Gee, strike a blow for
freedom."

Yet, Bidzos continues, "he did this with every intention of making
money. It was clearly to make money, no doubt about it. He told me just
before he released it, '</span><span class="n">Hey</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">I</span><span class="s1">'ve been working on it for six years, I'</span><span class="n">ve</span>
<span class="n">put</span> <span class="n">my</span> <span class="n">whole</span> <span class="n">life</span> <span class="n">into</span> <span class="n">it</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">I</span><span class="s1">'m behind on my mortgage payments and I need
to get something out of it."

Bidzos says he approached Zimmermann again several months later after
PGP was published and it was clear the free privacy program was not
going to go away anytime soon. "We told him that if he stopped
distributing PGP, we wouldn'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">sue</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">he</span> <span class="n">signed</span> <span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">agreement</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" Bidzos
recalls. "</span><span class="n">He</span> <span class="n">was</span> <span class="n">very</span> <span class="n">quick</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">sign</span> <span class="n">it</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">But</span> <span class="n">he</span><span class="s1">'s been violating the
agreement ever since he signed it."

Zimmermann replies that at one time he did entertain the idea of making
some money off PGP. But he insists he gave that up before the software
package was published.

"I decided to give PGP away in the interests of changing society, which
it is now doing," he says. "The whole reason I got involved was
politics. I did not miss mortgage payments in the hopes of getting rich.
Just look at my bookshelf. I'</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">politically</span> <span class="n">committed</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">a</span>
<span class="n">history</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">political</span> <span class="n">activism</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="s2">"

Zimmermann adds he's uncertain whether he's violated any of RSA's
patents, but he contends that if he did, the law doesn't make much sense
to him. "</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">respect</span> <span class="n">copyrights</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">" he says. "</span><span class="n">But</span> <span class="n">what</span> <span class="n">we</span><span class="s1">'re talking about
there is a patent on a math formula. It'</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">like</span> <span class="n">Isaac</span> <span class="n">Newton</span> <span class="n">patenting</span>
<span class="n">Force</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">Mass</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="n">Acceleration</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">You</span><span class="s1">'d have to pay royalty every time you
threw a baseball."

He also acknowledges that he signed a nondistribution agreement with RSA
Data Security for Pretty Good Privacy. But he insists that the has
abided by it-- although admittedly only in the strictest legal sense.
For example, while Zimmermann says he doesn'</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">update</span> <span class="k">or</span> <span class="n">distribute</span> <span class="n">PGP</span>
<span class="n">himself</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">he</span> <span class="n">concedes</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">he</span> <span class="n">freely</span> <span class="n">gives</span> <span class="n">direction</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">worldwide</span>

controlled the message as well. In _The_ _Codebreakers_, a 1967 book

<span class="n">Senate</span><span class="s1">'s Omnibus Crime Bill contained a provision that would have
effectively mandated that any private encoding system contain a "back
door" that law enforcement agencies could enter if they suspected any
misdeeds by the sender or receiver of a message. The clause was pulled
after an uproar from computer users, data security companies and civil
liberty organizations.

Despite the failure of the 1991 bill (as well as a 1992 FBI-sponsored
version that would have outlawed the use of tap-proof cryptology over
digital phone systems), the government has not given up on its attempt
to control encryption. Rather, it has simply shifted strategy.

 should hit the shelves by the end of the year.
