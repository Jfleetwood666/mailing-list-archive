Subject: BATF GOES FOR COVER-UP OF WACO FIASCO,
Organization: Ideology Busters, Inc.
Date: Fri, 3 Sep 1993 17:35:28 GMT

           BATF GOES FOR COVER-UP OF WACO FIASCO,
            WRITE TO TREASURY NOW TO PROTEST!!!
 
	The people who launched the disastrous raid on the Branch Dividian
compound in Waco, Texas, have now mounted an attack on the American
people's right to know facts behind the tragedy. The Tresury Department
is seeking to deny public access to invesitgative reports probing the
government's actions leading to the Waco conflagration
 
     You have until September 15 to protest against this cover-up.
 
Comments (preferably in triplicate) should be sent to the Dept. of the
Tresaury, Office of Enforcemnet, Room 4312, 1500 Pennslyvania Ave.,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20220.
 
                           WRITE NOW!
 
	It has been reported that the Treasury wants to lockup many of the
findings of the Waco investigation to "protect investigative techniques
and procedures."  What they are really doing is hiding the truth from
the American people and preventing the people from making an accurate
judgment on the BATF actions in Waco.  This action is being taken at teh
same time critizism of the raid is mounting.
 
	The affidavit used to justify the search warrant used in Waco has
come under intense criticism, with stories in a number of major papers,
the Washington Times the latest (Sept. 2).  Experts who have researched
the warrant have stated that it never should have been granted because
the affidavit did not meet legal requirements.
 
	Specifically cited were: a quote attributed to Koresh regarding
the LA riots, said to have been spoken three weeks before the riots
happened; no probable cause based on information included in the
warrant; inaccurate description of the firearms in possession of Koresh;
and only technical, if any, violations of firearms laws.  As a result of
this intense pressure, there has been speculation in the press that
Stephen Higgins, BATF Director and other top BATF officials may be
forced out.  However, to counter the growing outcry, the Treasury is now
taking steps to seal away information from the investigation of the
tragedy.  That is, they are trying to cover it all up.
 
	Below is the text of a proposed rule change that would lock up the
files of the "Waco Administrative Review Group Investigation", the panel
assigned to investigate the assault on the Branch Davidian Compound.
This means that Freedom of Information Act requests for information will
be denied, and the public will not have access to this information.
This is a blatant effort to cover-up the blunders in Waco.  It can only
be stopped if people cry-out in protest.
