&gt; Taxpayer Assets Project
&gt; Information Policy Note
&gt; September 15, 1993
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      TAXPAYER ASSETS PROJECT FILES COMMENTS WITH FCC ON
&gt;      PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (PCS) SPECTRUM AUCTION
&gt; 
&gt;      On Friday September 10, 1993 the Taxpayer Assets Project
&gt; (TAP) filed comments with the Federal Communications Commission
&gt; (FCC) on the proposed auction of spectrum for Personal
&gt; Communications Services (PCS).  PCS is the name for a new class
&gt; of wireless telecommunications services that industry groups
&gt; claim will generate more than $200 billion in revenue by the year
&gt; 2010.
&gt; 
&gt;      TAP's comments addressed two issues, the size of the
&gt; spectrum blocks to be auctioned, and the bidding methods used to
&gt; allocate the PCS licenses.
&gt; 
&gt; BACKGROUND
&gt; 
&gt;      Congress and the Clinton Administration will use auctions to
&gt; award licenses to use new spectrum that was previously allocated
&gt; to the government and other uses.  Industry groups are engaged in
&gt; intense lobbying over the terms of the auctions, which will be
&gt; designed by the FCC.  A key issue is the number of licenses to be
&gt; awarded in each market.  PCS Action, Inc., an industry trade
&gt; group, wants the FCC to limit the number of licenses in each
&gt; market, in order to limit "excessive" competition, that would
&gt; "marginalize" PCS services.  PCS Action prefers two licenses per
&gt; market, and "certainly no more than three."  PCS Action, Inc. has
&gt; also argued that large blocks of spectrum (40 Mhz) are needed for
&gt; each license for technical reasons.  If the large 40 Mhz blocks
&gt; are used the FCC can award no more than 3 license per market.
&gt; 
&gt;      Other potential license holders or PCS competitors have
&gt; argued that much smaller spectrum blocks are technically
&gt; feasible, and would provide more post auction competition.  MCI
&gt; and Bell Atlantic have filed comments with the FCC saying that 20
&gt; Mhz blocks are adequate, and some PCS bidders have indicated that
&gt; blocks as small as 10 Mhz may be large enough.  The issue of the
&gt; size of spectrum blocks is important, since it will determine the
&gt; maximum number of licenses that can be issued in each local
&gt; market.
&gt; 
&gt;      A second issue that has received less attention concerns the
&gt; methods used to receive revenues from winning bidders.  The
&gt; government can require bidders to submit up front cash payments,
&gt; or payments over time, including royalties against future PCS
&gt; revenues.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; TAP COMMENTS ON THE SIZE OF PCS SPECTRUM BLOCKS
&gt; 
&gt;      Regarding the size of the spectrum blocks to be auctioned,
&gt; TAP said:
&gt; 
&gt;      The FCC should allow bidders to purchase the smallest
&gt;      possible blocks of the spectrum, while providing for
&gt;      mechanisms that will allow bidders to aggregate or
&gt;      consolidate blocks, subject to FCC approval. . .
&gt; 
&gt;      By choosing the smallest possible blocks of spectrum to
&gt;      auction, the FCC will assign the initial rights to use the
&gt;      spectrum to a potentially large group of license holders,
&gt;      who can be expected to consider a wider range on innovative
&gt;      PCS services.  However, some important PCS services may
&gt;      require the larger bandwidth.  The FCC can easily
&gt;      accommodate this problem by allowing bidders to aggregate
&gt;      and consolidate spectrum blocks, in order to offer higher
&gt;      bandwidth services.  The aggregation and consolidation of
&gt;      spectrum blocks should be subject to an FCC finding that the
&gt;      new allocation is in the public interest. This procedure
&gt;      would allow more flexibility in determining the size of
&gt;      allocation blocks with each market, and provide better
&gt;      opportunities for smaller firms to bid on spectrum.
&gt; 
&gt;      The initial size of spectrum blocks will be an important
&gt; decision, since it is unlikely that the FCC will "split"
&gt; licenses, even if it turns out that smaller blocks are adequate
&gt; to provide useful PCS services.  By beginning with the "smallest
&gt; possible blocks," the FCC can always allow license holders to
&gt; aggregate and consolidate blocks, if the larger blocks are truly
&gt; needed.  This will also allow local markets to consider a wider
&gt; range of configurations, including combinations of small and
&gt; large blocks, as PCS markets develop.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; TAP CAUTIONS AGAINST BIDDING METHODS THAT RELY EXCESSIVELY UPON
&gt; UP FRONT CASH PAYMENTS
&gt; 
&gt;      TAP also told the FCC the auction should not rely
&gt; excessively on up front cash payments.  The federal government
&gt; can structure the payments on the license in a number of ways,
&gt; including up front cash payments, fixed payments spread out over
&gt; several years, or payments which are contingent on future cash
&gt; flows, such as royalties on future revenues or units of services
&gt; provided.
&gt; 
&gt;      The PCS spectrum auction will be the largest non-financial
&gt; auction held by the federal government.  But the economic value
&gt; of a PCS license will depend upon a highly uncertain cash flow
&gt; over the long period of time.  If the FCC auctions the licenses
&gt; to the highest cash bidders, the government will be asking firms
&gt; to pay now for the rights to enter a business that will not be
&gt; fully developed for many years.
&gt; 
&gt;      TAP raised two objections to excessive reliance upon up
&gt; front cash payments to auction the spectrum.  First, many smaller
&gt; firms will be unlikely to raise enough cash to bid against the
&gt; larger incumbents in the telecommunications markets.  Second,
&gt; bidders will discount the future "economic rents" from licenses
&gt; by a higher "discount rate" than the government's costs of
&gt; capital (the rate of interest on its bonds), leading to excessive
&gt; discounting of license revenues.
&gt; 
&gt;      In order to promote more competition in the auctions, and
&gt; also to increase the present value of license payments, TAP urges
&gt; the FCC to consider a bidding system that combines cash payments
&gt; with payments that are contingent upon future PCS revenues, such
&gt; as a royalty on future PCS revenues.  We believe that over the
&gt; long run, the government (the taxpayers) will earn more from
&gt; royalties on a mature PCS market, than it will earn from up front
&gt; cash payments for licenses.
