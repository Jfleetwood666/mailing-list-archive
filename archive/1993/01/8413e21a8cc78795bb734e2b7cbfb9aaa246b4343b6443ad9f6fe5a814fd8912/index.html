Here is an excerpt from a description of one version of Chaum's
digital cash, which I posted on Nov. 25:

&gt; There are lots of proposals for electronic cash in the literature,
&gt; mostly very complex.  I think one of Chaum's simpler proposals would be
&gt; adequate for email "banking".  This proposal, from the beginning of
&gt; his paper "Untraceable Electronic Cash" in Crypto 88(?), goes like
&gt; this:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Alice chooses a random x and r, and supplies the bank with
&gt; B=r^3*f(x) mod n, where f is a one-way function (like MD5), and n is
&gt; the modulus for the bank's public key.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The bank takes the third root of B (e.g. via an RSA decryption) and
&gt; sends it back to Alice: D = r * f(x)^(1/3), and withdraws one dollar from
&gt; her account.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Alice extracts C = f(x)^(1/3) by dividing D by r.  (Note that
&gt; division can be done mod n without knowing the factors of n, but it's
&gt; rather complicated.)
&gt; 
&gt; 4. To pay Bob one dollar, Alice gives him (x, C).
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Bob can verify that C = f(x)^(1/3), but he still has to send (x, C)
&gt; to the bank in order to make sure that x hasn't been used before.
&gt; Otherwise Alice could spend (x, C) twice.  The bank increases Bob's
&gt; account by one dollar.
&gt; 
&gt; This scheme is pretty simple and provides untraceability - the bank
&gt; saw B and D but not C, so although it can verify that (x, C) is legit,
&gt; it can't correlate that with Alice's withdrawal.
&gt; 
&gt; The main disadvantage of this approach is that Bob has to send (x, C)
&gt; to the bank right away (or at least before sending Alice anything in
&gt; return for her cash) to verify that the cash hasn't been used before.
&gt; But in email, where turnarounds of a day or more aren't unusual, this
&gt; should be tolerable.
&gt; 
&gt; Alice and Bob could be pseudonyms, using anonymous addresses to
&gt; communicate with each other and with the bank.
&gt; 
&gt; Different denominations of cash could correspond to different
&gt; exponents than "3" in the example above.  (That is, $1 would use
&gt; C=f(x)^(1/3), $2 would use C=f(x)^(1/5), $4 would use C=f(x)^(1/7),
&gt; and so on.)
&gt; 
&gt; Technically, this would be quite easy to implement, using the code in
&gt; PGP for the arithmetic, and MD5 for the one-way function.  We'd need
&gt; to define a few message formats.  The RFC1113 ascii encoding from PGP
&gt; could be used as well.
&gt; 
&gt; The "social" problems are more challenging, it seems to me.  What is
&gt; the backing for this electronic money?  Why do people care what their
&gt; bank balances are?  Is this stuff really worth anything?
&gt; 
&gt; One possibility is to base digital cash on real money.  People would
&gt; open a pseudonymous account via email, then postal-mail dollars to the
&gt; bank, enclosing their account number so the bank would know whom to
&gt; credit with the deposit.  Later, if someone wanted to withdraw "real
&gt; money" from their account they would have to give a real postal
&gt; address where it could be mailed.  Now the electronic money is worth
&gt; real dollars.  Even if people didn't deposit or withdraw very often,
&gt; it still has value because of the backing.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, this approach would currently be illegal (at least,
&gt; unless you actually were a real bank!).  If there were some way the
&gt; bank itself could be anonymous, it might survive, but I don't see how
&gt; to mail it money while keeping the anonymity.  Still, we could
&gt; consider experimenting with this on a small scale with accounts of no
&gt; more than a few dollars.  As long as it was clearly an experiment I
&gt; doubt that any prosecutions would result even if it attracted
&gt; government attention, because the expense involved in court costs
&gt; would be so disproportionate to the few dollars involved in this
&gt; technically illegal act.
&gt; 
&gt; Another approach would be not to try backing the digital cash at all,
&gt; or rather backing it implicitly by the determination of various people
&gt; to accept it and perform services or supply goods in return for it.
&gt; Tim's offer to Xerox papers in return for digital cash would be one
&gt; example.  Perhaps others could provide some other services.  It would
&gt; be great if some shareware author would accept digital cash as a
&gt; symbol of support for crypto anonymity.
&gt; 
&gt; One problem that I see with this approach is how you determine the
&gt; size of the money supply.  Or, in other words, how does new digital
&gt; cash get started circulating?  How do people get new accounts, and how
&gt; much money is in them?
&gt; 
&gt; If these problems can be solved, a big advantage of this approach is
&gt; that the banker can be anonymous.  He would be known only by his
&gt; anonymous address and his public key(s).  This would provide some
&gt; safety in the event that even a small-scale experiment like this
&gt; was targetted for a crackdown.
&gt; 
&gt; Another issue is the prospect of multiple "banks", each issuing their
&gt; own (incompatible) cash.  How would they compete?  Perhaps in terms of
&gt; rapid turnaround?  Some might choose to be anonymous, others would go
&gt; public.  The latter would have the advantage that people might trust
&gt; them more, but OTOH there is more chance of your bank account
&gt; disappearing after a crackdown for a public bank than an anonymous
&gt; one.
&gt; 
&gt; Lots to think about here!
