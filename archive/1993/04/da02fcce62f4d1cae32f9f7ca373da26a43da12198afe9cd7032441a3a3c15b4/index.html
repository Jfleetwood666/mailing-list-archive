I had asked Mitch to repost any communications that
have gone over this list. He has.

I appreciate his willing to clear up this issue.

As I have stated before, I believe him, that NIST simply
created this list of people they wanted to be in direct
contact with.

&gt; I received the statement of the Press Secretary and the public fact sheet

&gt; 
&gt; Following this is a thread between Gerano Cannoni and Martin Hellman.  I
&gt; have deleted the text of Marty's longest response, as it is being

&gt; Last, there is a single message from A. Pagett Patterson.

&gt; And that's it (assuming I haven't missed something in reviewing my

&gt; Feel free to re-post this, put in on an FTP, whatever.  I don't have any

&gt; 
&gt; Good day,
&gt; as a non-citizien of USA I have read your announcment of the
&gt; 'Clipper-Chip' with great interest, and am happy to see a increase
&gt; in lawful privacy in the USA. I hope this policy will extend to
&gt; other countries too.
&gt; In the meantime I suspect two flaws in the 'Clipper-Chip' as it was
&gt; announced today via NIST/electronic media.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Keeping secret the algorithm which performs encryption is in my
&gt;    humble opinion a bad idea. It hinders 'Clipper' to get publicly
&gt;    accepted, and hinders the minute examination of the Clipper-
&gt;    Algorithm by other then a few experts.
&gt;    But I am sure this was well considered.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the important suggestion :=)
&gt; 
&gt; 2) By splitting the 80-Bit-Key of clipper in two parts, and give
&gt;    them to different organizations, you add an uneeded WEAKNESS
&gt;    to the escrow-system. This way, corruption of one escrow will
&gt;    allow an easier attack on the Key than might be possible.
&gt;    (e.g. if I obtain 40 bits of possible 80 bits keys, exhaustive
&gt;     keysearch is definitively no problem.)
&gt;    You might instead generate 2 (or even more, if this ist not
&gt;    politically indesired) 80-Bit-Sequences which, when XOR-ed
&gt;    together will provide the original, needed key, but alone they
&gt;    are worthless. I am sure persons with knowledge in this area, which
&gt;    surely can be found at NIST (or wherever) will agree.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that this remark is of interest for you.
&gt; 
&gt; Friendly greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Germano Caronni
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.
&gt; I am sure you have remarked, that the current policy is interpretable
&gt; to tend toward an abolition of 'unbreakable' secure communication
&gt; via electronic Media, and hope that this will _not_ come true.

&gt; 
&gt; In a conversation with NSA today, I was told
&gt; that two random 80-bit numbers will be XORed to produce
&gt; the 80-bit key and the two individual numbers kept by
&gt; two separate escrow authorities  -- who they are is
&gt; to be decided. So your suggestion is, in fact, how it
&gt; will be handled.

&gt; Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,
&gt; etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology)
&gt; announcing the "Clipper Chip" crypto device. Several messges
&gt; on the net have asked for more technical details, and some have
&gt; been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given
&gt; the lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out
&gt; is your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday
&gt; to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing
&gt; details. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this
&gt; to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my
&gt; facts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know
