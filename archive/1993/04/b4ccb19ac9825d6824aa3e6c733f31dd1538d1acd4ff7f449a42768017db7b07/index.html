I recommend this conference.  It's cheap to attend, you'll meet almost all
the world-class cryptographers there are (out in the open, as well as some
of the spooks), the food is great, and the campus is a fun place to visit.
Everything is in walking distance, and the ocean and cliffs are right there.
As well as a lot of interesting people and discussions.

I wouldn't submit a paper unless it was a serious academic paper, but
you could submit a "rump session" talk about some of the cypherpunk
activities you've been doing.  You'll get five or ten minutes to
explain and handle questions, with overhead slides.  The presentations
have ranged from how to break DES (Adi Shamir &amp; Eli Biham) to ideas
about building MSDOS viruses that would infect millions of PC's to do
brute force crypto cracking (Steve White of IBM, I think).  I've
spoken at two of the last three rump sessions about one or another
social or political aspect of cryptography.  Whit Diffie chairs the
rump session, which is held after dinner with beer and wine, and you
can send him proposals for your talk by email (diffie@eng.sun.com).

        CRYPTO '93  -  Conference Announcement &amp; Final Call for Papers
............................................................................

The Thirteenth Annual CRYPTO Conference, sponsored by the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in cooperation with 
the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, 
the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, and Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom), 
will be held on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, 
on August 22-26, 1993. Original research papers and technical expository 
talks 
are solicited on all practical and theoretical aspects of cryptology. It is 
anticipated that some talks may also be presented by special invitation of 
the 
Program Committee.
- -------------------------        
INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:  Authors are requested to send 12 copies of a 
detailed abstract (not a full paper) by April 26, 1993, to the Program Chair 
at the address given below. A limit of 10 pages of 12pt type (not counting 
the bibliography or the title page) is placed on all submissions. Submissions 
must arrive on time or be postmarked no later than April 21, 1993 and sent by 
airmail in order to receive consideration by the Program Committee. It is 
required that submissions start with a succinct statement of the problem 
addressed, the solution proposed, and its significance to cryptology, 
appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Technical development directed to 
the specialist should follow as needed.
- -------------------------        
Abstracts that have been submitted to other conferences that have proceedings 
are NOT eligible for submission.

Submissions MUST BE ANONYMOUS. This means that names and affiliations of 
authors should only appear on the title page of the submission; it should 
be possible to remove this page and send the papers to Program Committee 
members. A Latex style file that produces output in this format is available 
by email from the Program Chair.

Authors will be informed of acceptance or rejection in a letter mailed on 
or before June 21, 1993. A compilation of all accepted abstracts will be 
available at the conference in the form of pre-proceedings. Authors of 
accepted abstracts will be allowed to submit revised versions for the 
pre-proceedings. A revised abstract should contain only minor changes and 
corrections to the originally submitted abstract. All revised abstracts must 
be received by the Program Chair by July 16, 1993. THE 10 PAGE LIMIT WILL BE 
STRICTLY ENFORCED for the pre-proceedings.

Complete conference proceedings are expected to be published in Springer-
Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series at a later date, pending 
negotiation.

        CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993)
............................................................................

THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on 
cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE 
Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer 
Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and 
Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program 
for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of 
the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees 
at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.

In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the 
program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for 
informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to 
demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest. 
If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General 
Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include 
hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a 
beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included 
in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of 
the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent 
to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are 
available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference 
participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the 
dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate 
arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is 
enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. 
However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire 
a parking permit.

TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the 
Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including 
American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service 
will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday 
and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented 
in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the 
north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 
miles 
north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.

REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance 
at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late 
registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space 
is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached 
registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in 
full before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first 
come, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993. The 
conference fees include participation in the program and all social 
functions, 
as well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of 
Cryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals 
&gt;from dinner on Sunday to lunch on Thursday. Technical sessions will run 
&gt;from Monday morning to Thursday at noon. A very limited number of stipends 
are available to those unable to obtain funding. Applications for stipends 
should be sent to the General Chair before June 4, 1993.

        CRYPTO '93  -  Hotel Information
............................................................................

For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories, the following is a 
partial list of hotels in the area. Those who choose to stay off campus are 
responsible for making their own reservations, and early reservations are 
advised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara. Note that Goleta 
is closer to UCSB than Santa Barbara, but that a car will probably be 
required to travel between any hotel and the campus. All prices are subject 
to change; prices should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels 
directly. However, mention CRYPTO'93 when you are making your reservation and 
in several of the hotels listed you will be eligible for the university rate 
which can be significantly less than the normal rates. We are not able to 
block rooms in these hotels, so please make reservations as early as 
possible. The quality of the hotels range from rather expensive beach-front 
resorts to basic inexpensive accommodations. For further information, try
