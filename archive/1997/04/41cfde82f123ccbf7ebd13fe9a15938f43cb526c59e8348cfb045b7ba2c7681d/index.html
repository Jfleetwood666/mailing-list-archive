&gt; Dear friend,
&gt; 
&gt; The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking 
&gt; look at.  It can be started with VERY MINIMAL outlay and the income return
&gt; is TREMENDOUS!
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;
&gt; You are about to make at least $50,000 - In less than 90 days
&gt; Read the enclosed program...THEN READ IT AGAIN!...
&gt; &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my
&gt; fingers.  Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave
&gt; some thought and study to it.
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Christopher Erickson.  Two years ago, the corporation I
&gt; worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was
&gt; eliminated.  After unproductive job interviews,  I decided to open my
&gt; own business.  Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial
&gt; problems.  I owed my family, friends, and creditors over $35,000.  The
&gt; economy was taking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to
&gt; make ends meet.  I had to refinance and borrow against my home to
&gt; support my family and struggling business.  I truly believe it was
&gt; wrong for me to be in debt like this.  AT THAT MOMENT something
&gt; significant happened in my life and I am writing to share my experience
&gt; in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER....FINANCIALLY!!!
&gt; 
&gt; In mid-December, I received this program via email.  Six months prior
&gt; to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on
&gt; various business opportunities.  All of the programs I received, in my
&gt; opinion, were not cost effective.  They were either too difficult for
&gt; me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk
&gt; to see if they worked or not.  One claimed I'd make a million dollars
&gt; in one year...it didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it.
&gt; 
&gt; But like I was saying, in December of '95 I received this program.  I
&gt; didn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing
&gt; list.  THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to
&gt; make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Here
&gt; was a MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.  I could invest as much as I wanted to
&gt; start, without putting me further in debt.  After I got a pencil and
&gt; paper and figured it out, I would at least get my money back.  After
&gt; determining that the program is LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided "WHY NOT".
&gt; Initially I sent out 10,000 emails.  It only cost me about $15.00 for
&gt; my time on-line.  The great thing about email is that I didn't need any
&gt; money for printing to send out the program, only the cost to fulfill my
&gt; orders.  I am telling you like it is, I hope it doesn't turn you off,
&gt; but I promised myself that I would not "rip-off" anyone, no matter how
&gt; much money it cost me!
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of good programs to help do this are Ready Aim Fire, an email
&gt; extracting program @ http://microsyssolutions.com/raf/  and  Cyberpromotions
&gt; who has a pop3 ISP account specifically for direct emailing at
&gt; http://www.cyberpromo.com
&gt; 
&gt; In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1.
&gt; By January 13th, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1.  When you read
&gt; the GUARANTEE in the program, you will see that "YOU MUST RECEIVE 15 
&gt; TO 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF YOU DON'T,  
&gt; SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!"  My first step in making 
&gt; $50,000 in 20 to 90 days was done.  By January 30th, I had received 
&gt; 196 orders for REPORT #2.  If you go back to the GUARANTEE, "YOU 
&gt; MUST RECEIVE 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 
&gt; TWO WEEKS.  IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.  
&gt; ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU
&gt; WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL."  Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2,
&gt; 96 more than I needed.  So I sat back and relaxed.  By March 19th, of
&gt; my mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every
&gt; day.
&gt; 
&gt; I paid off  ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.  Please take
&gt; time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!
&gt; Remember,  it wont work  if you don't try it.  This program does work,
&gt; but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rules of not trying to
&gt; place your name in a different place.  It doesn't work, you'll lose out
&gt; on a  lot  of  money!  REPORT  #2  explains this.  Always follow the
&gt; guarantee, 15 to 20  orders  for REPORT #1, and 100 or more orders for
&gt; REPORT #2 and you will make  $50,000 or more in 20 to 90 days.  I AM
&gt; LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS !!!
&gt; 
&gt; If you choose not to participate in this program, I'm sorry.  It really
&gt; is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you.  If you choose
&gt; to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to
&gt; financial security.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble
&gt; like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a
&gt; sign.  I DID!
&gt; 
&gt; 					Sincerely,
&gt; 					Christopher Erickson
&gt; 
&gt; PS  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled
&gt; up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!
&gt; 
&gt; "THREW IT AWAY"
&gt; 
&gt; "I  had  received  this program before.  I  threw  it away, but later
&gt; wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I had no idea
&gt; who to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was emailed
&gt; another copy of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it came.  I
&gt; DIDN'T throw this one away.  I made $41,000 on the first try."
&gt; 
&gt; 					Dawn W., Evansville, IN
&gt; 
&gt; "NO FREE LUNCH"
&gt; 
&gt; "My late father always told me, 'remember, Alan, there is no free lunch
&gt; in life.  You get out of life what you put into it.'  Through trial and
&gt; error and a somewhat slow frustrating start, I finally figured it out.
&gt; The program works very well, I just had to find the right target group
&gt; of people to email it to.  So far this year, I have made over $63,000
&gt; using this program.  I know my dad would have been very proud of me."
&gt; 
&gt; 					Alan B., Philadelphia, PA
&gt; 
&gt; A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM
&gt; 
&gt; By the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the
&gt; enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a
&gt; program,  and  one that is legal,  could not have been created by an
&gt; amateur.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business for
&gt; ten years.  Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was doing
&gt; the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't
&gt; working.  Finally, I figured it out.  It wasn't me, it was the economy.
&gt; Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been
&gt; with us since 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened to the
&gt; unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand experience.
&gt; There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.
&gt; 
&gt; The middle class was vanishing.  Those who knew what they were doing
&gt; invested wisely and moved up.  Those who did not, including those who
&gt; never had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks
&gt; of the poor.  As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET
&gt; POORER."  The traditional methods of making money will never allow you
&gt; to "move up" or "get rich", inflation will see to that.
&gt; 
&gt; You have just received information that can give you financial freedom
&gt; for the rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
&gt; EFFORT."  You can make more money in the next few months than you have
&gt; ever imagined.
&gt; 
&gt; I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your money, nor
&gt; anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program.  I have
&gt; already made over FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the
&gt; program after sending out over 16,000 programs.  Now I have several
&gt; offices which market this and several other programs here in the US and
&gt; overseas.  By the Spring, we wish to market the 'Internet' by a
&gt; partnership with AMERICA ON LINE.
&gt; 
&gt; Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Do not change it in any way.
&gt; It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to email a copy of
&gt; this exciting program to everyone that you can think of.  One of the
&gt; people you send this to may send out 50,000...and your name will be on
&gt; every one of them!.  Remember though, the more you send out, the more
&gt; potential customers you will reach.
&gt; 
&gt; So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and
&gt; opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!
&gt; 
&gt; "THINK ABOUT IT"
&gt; 
&gt; Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take
&gt; a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil and
&gt; figure out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the
&gt; worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will
&gt; still make a lot of money!  Definitely get back what you invested.  Any
&gt; doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in.  IT WORKS!
&gt; 
&gt; 					Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC
&gt; 
&gt; HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$
&gt; 
&gt; Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and
&gt; we'll assume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each.
&gt; Let's also assume that the mailing receives a .5% response.  Using a
&gt; good list the response could be much better.  Also many people will
&gt; send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000.  But
&gt; continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs.  With a
&gt; 5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1.  Those 10 people
&gt; respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000.  Out
&gt; of those .5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail
&gt; out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000.  The .5% response to
&gt; that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3.  Those 1,000 send out 2,000
&gt; programs each for a 2,000,000 total.  The .5% response to that is
&gt; 10,000 orders for REPORT #4.  That's 10,000 five dollar bills for you.
&gt; CASH!!!!  Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5000 +
&gt; $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU 
&gt; MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!  
&gt; DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE 
&gt; OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF ONLY 2,000.  Believe 
&gt; me, many people will do that and more!  By the way, your cost to participate 
&gt; in this is practically nothing.  You obviously already have an internet
&gt; connection 
&gt; and email is FREE!!!  REPORT#3 will show you the best methods for bulk
&gt; emailing
&gt; and purchasing email lists.
&gt; 
&gt; THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.  It does not
&gt; require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best
&gt; of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mail.  If
&gt; you believe that someday you'll get that big break that you've been
&gt; waiting for, THIS IS IT!  Simply follow the instructions, and your
&gt; dream will come true.  This multi-level email order marketing program
&gt; works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME.  Email is the sales tool of the
&gt; future.  Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
&gt; advertising NOW!!  The longer you wait, the more people will be doing
&gt; business using email.  Get your piece of this action!!
&gt; 
&gt; MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is
&gt; being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research
&gt; and The Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all
&gt; goods and services will be sold throughout Multi-level Methods by the
&gt; mid to late 1990's.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the
&gt; 500,000 millionaires in the US, 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the
&gt; last several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics show 45 people become
&gt; millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.
&gt; 
&gt; INSTRUCTIONS
&gt; 
&gt; We at Erris Mail Order Marketing Business, have a method of raising
&gt; capital that REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME.  I am sure that you could
&gt; use $50,000 to $125,000 in the next 20 to 90 days.  Before you say
&gt; "Bull", please read the program carefully.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
&gt; opportunity.  Basically, this is what we do:  As with all multi-level
&gt; business, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling
&gt; our products.  Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi-
&gt; level business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent.
&gt; YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE FILLED THROUGH THE MAIL, so you are not
&gt; involved in personal selling.  You do it privately in your own home,
&gt; store or office.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the GREATEST Multi-level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:
&gt; 
&gt; Step (1)   Order all four 4 REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER.  Do this
&gt;            by ordering the REPORT from each of the four 4 names listed
&gt;            on the next page.  For each REPORT, send $5 CASH and a SELF-
&gt;            ADDRESSED, STAMPED envelope  (BUSINESS SIZE #10) to the
&gt;            person listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT.  International orders
&gt;            should also include $1 extra for postage.  It is essential
&gt;            that you specify the NAME and NUMBER of the report requested
&gt;            to the person you are ordering from.  You will need ALL FOUR
&gt;            4 REPORTS because you will be REPRINTING and RESELLING them.
&gt;            DO NOT alter the names or sequence other than what the
&gt;            instructions say.  IMPORTANT:  Always provide same-day
&gt;            service on all orders.
&gt; 
&gt; Step (2)   Replace  the  name  and  address  under  REPORT #1  with
&gt;            yours,  moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.
&gt;            Drop  the  name and address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3,
&gt;            moving the one that was there to REPORT #4.  The name and
&gt;            address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list
&gt;            and this party  is  no doubt on the way to the bank.  When
&gt;            doing   this,   make   certain   you  type  the  names  and
&gt;            addresses ACCURATELY!  DO NOT MIX UP MOVING PRODUCT/REPORT
&gt;            POSITIONS!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Step (3)   Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it
&gt;            as a text (.txt) file in it's own directory to be used with
&gt;            whatever email program you like.  Again, REPORT #3 will tell
&gt;            you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email
&gt;            lists.
&gt; 
&gt; Step (4)   Email a copy of the entire program (all of this is very
&gt;            important) to everyone whose address you can get your hands
&gt;            on. Start with friends and relatives since you can encourage
&gt;            them to take  advantage of this  fabulous  money-making
&gt;            opportunity.  That's what I did.  And they love me now, more
&gt;            than ever.  Then, email to anyone and everyone!  Use your
&gt;            imagination!  You can get email addresses from companies on
&gt;            the internet who specialize in email mailing lists.  These
&gt;            are very cheap, 100,000 addresses for around $35.00.
&gt; 
&gt; IMPORTANT:  You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so
&gt; always request a FRESH, NEW list. You will find out where to purchase
&gt; these lists when you order the four 4 REPORTS.
&gt; 
&gt; ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!
&gt; 
&gt; REQUIRED REPORTS
&gt; 
&gt; ***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***
&gt; 
&gt; ALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPE
&gt; AND $5 CASH FOR EACH ORDER REQUESTING THE
&gt; SPECIFIC REPORT BY NAME AND NUMBER

&gt; 
&gt; CONCLUSION
&gt; 
&gt; .I am enjoying my fortune that I made by sending out this program.
&gt; You too, will be making money in 20 to 90 days, if you follow the
&gt; SIMPLE STEPS outlined in this mailing.
&gt; 
&gt; To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make financial
&gt; decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into investments,
&gt; 
&gt; retire or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of money hold you
&gt; back.
&gt; 
&gt; However, very few people reach financial independence, because when
&gt; opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is much easier to say
&gt; "NO" than "YES", and this is the question that you must answer.  Will
&gt; YOU ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it?
&gt; If you do nothing, you have indeed missed something and nothing will
&gt; change.  Please re-read this material, this is a special opportunity.
&gt; If you have any questions, please feel free to write to the sender of
&gt; this information.  You will get a prompt and informative reply.
&gt; 
&gt; My method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5 that
&gt; costs me pennies to produce and email.  I should also point out that
&gt; this program is legal and everyone who participates WILL make money.
&gt; This is not a chain letter or pyramid scam.  At times you have probably
&gt; received chain letters, asking you to send money, on faith, but getting
&gt; NOTHING in return, NO product what-so-ever!  Not only are chain letters
&gt; illegal, but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite
&gt; unattractive.
&gt; 
&gt; You are offering a legitimate product to your people.  After they
&gt; purchase the product from you, they reproduce more and resell them.
&gt; It's simple free enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed material,
&gt; the PRODUCT is a series of four 4 FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS.  The
&gt; information contained in these REPORTS will not only help you in making
&gt; your participation in this program more rewarding, but will be useful
&gt; to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead.
&gt; You are also buying the rights to reprint all of the REPORTS, which
&gt; will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program.  The
&gt; concise one and two page REPORTS you will be buying can easily be
&gt; reproduced at a local copy center for a cost off about 3 cents a copy.
&gt; Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!
&gt; 
&gt; "IT WAS TRULY AMAZING"
&gt; 
&gt; "Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
&gt; mind to participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I
&gt; decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no way
&gt; that I could not get enough orders to at least get my money back.  BOY,
&gt; was I ever surprised when I found my medium sized post office box
&gt; crammed with orders!  I will make more money this year than any ten
&gt; years of my life before."

&gt; 
&gt; TIPS FOR SUCCESS
&gt; 
&gt; Send for your four 4 REPORTS immediately so you will have them when the
&gt; orders start coming in.  When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out
&gt; the product/service to comply with US Postal and Lottery laws.  Title
&gt; 18 Sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that:  "A PRODUCT OR
&gt; SERVICE MUST BE EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RECEIVED."
&gt; 
&gt; WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPORTS TO ARRIVE:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	Name your new company. You can use your own name if you desire.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	Get a post office box (preferred).
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must remember,
&gt;         your name and address go next to REPORT #1 and the others all
&gt;         move down one, with the fourth one being bumped OFF the list.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.	Obtain as many email addresses as possible to send until you
&gt;         receive the information on mailing list companies in REPORT #3.
&gt; 
&gt; 5.	Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.  The
&gt;         more you send, and the quicker you send them, the more money
&gt;         you will make.
&gt; 
&gt; 6.	After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.
&gt; 
&gt; 7.	Copy the four 4 REPORTS so you are able to sent them out as
&gt;         soon as you receive an order. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROVIDE
&gt;         SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ORDERS YOU RECEIVE!
&gt; 
&gt; 8.	Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.
&gt; 
&gt; YOUR GUARANTEE
&gt; 
&gt; The check point which GUARANTEES your success is simply this:  you must
&gt; receive 15 to 20 orders for REPORT #1.  This is a must!!!  If you don't
&gt; within two weeks, email out more programs until you do.  Then a couple
&gt; of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2, if
&gt; you don't, send out more programs until you do.  Once you have received
&gt; 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, (take a deep breath) you can sit back
&gt; and  relax,  because  YOU  ARE  GOING TO  MAKE  AT  LEAST  $50,000.
&gt; Mathematically  it  is  a  proven  guarantee.   Of  those  who  have
&gt; participated in the program and reached the above GUARANTEES-ALL have
&gt; reached their $50,000 goal.  Also, remember, every time your name is
&gt; moved down the list you are in front of a different REPORT, so you can
&gt; keep track of your program by knowing what people are ordering from you.
&gt; IT'S THAT EASY, REALLY, IT IS!!!
&gt; 
&gt; REMEMBER:
&gt; "HE WHO DARES NOTHING, NEED NOT HOPE FOR ANYTHING."
&gt; "INVEST A LITTLE TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY NOW OR
&gt; SEARCH FOR IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE."
