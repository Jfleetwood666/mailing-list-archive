Hello;

"My research indicates the following material is of 
interest to you.  If you prefer not to be on this 
mailing list, please let us know, and you will be 
promptly removed."

I am on a mission, no I'm on a CRUSADE to educate people
that there are no "GET RICH QUICK" programs, only honest or
dishonest opportunities.  There are also, no "Miracle 
Products" or "Cure All Products".  Remember, what you see
isn't always what you get.  Anything that has the potential 
to be a money-earner will take some work, and sometimes
alot of work.

I (Christopher Miller) started this Company with the belief
that it shouldn't be necessary for you to spend a fortune to
be healthy and feel good. Also, I believe that there are far
too many companies that offer Business Opportunities only
to end up draining the Distributors bank account instead of
filling it. There are also many deceptive trade practices
taking place everyday where Con-Artists take advantage of
unsuspecting people.  Our products are very competitively 
priced and Distributorships are very inexpensive to operate.

Cosmic Enterprises, a world leader in manufacturing quality 
nutritional products.   

With its headquarters located in Iowa, La., Cosmic 
Enterprises has Independant Representatives in the U.S.,
Indonesia and the United Kingdom.  President Christopher
Miller who is the founder, started his Nutritional career 
working from home in his spare time, doing research on his 
own value packed Nutritional Energy Formula.

This energy product is the result many months of research,
shopping and testing.  I was searching for a product that
would satisfy the need for sustained energy levels, increased
mental alertness, balanced blood pressure and blood sugar 
levels along with antioxidant prtection and improved hormone
activity.  Not finding one, I started on a quest to find a 
manufacturing company that would want to do things my way.
After many months of searching and negotiations the result 
of my quest was born.  I called the formula Renew because
it does so many things.  It literally enhances every one of
the body processes and functions.

If all this sounds too good to be true, it's because we have
been programmed by large corporations all these years to 
beleive that the things we need to healthy are very very 
expensive.  In fact, just the opposite is true.

We at Cosmic Enterprises have gone to great lenghts to 
provide our customers with he most value-packed product that
has ever been placed on the market.  The pharmacalogical 
make up of Renew has been very well researched to ensure the
synergistic properties of the ingredients were not sacrificed.  
The majority of products on the market are made up of a
single ingredient and the rest of it is composed of fillers.
Just to give you an idea of how much filler material we've
consumed over the years, listen to this example.  Renew is 
packed in a "00" {double ought} capsule which can hold
from 850 milligrams up to well over 1000 milligrams of 
material depending upon the molecular weight of the
individual ingredients, most single ingredient products 
that are available in capsule form use a "0" {single ought}
capsule which can hold up to 550 milligrams of material or 
possibly much more depending on the weight.  

Now let's say that this product has 25 milligrams of active 
ingredient, then why is the pill so big?  It doesn't take a
mathematician to figure out that most of your money just 
went toward fillers instead of what you thought you were 
getting.  Also, many of these products come in tablet form, 
which means that they are capable of holding much more 
because the pill press compresses the ingredients.  So even 
though the tablet or caplet may be large, that doesn't mean 
there's alot of active ingredients.  There are, however, 
many multible ingredient products out there, some of them 
are very good I might add.  The truth is though, many 
products only use one or two main ingredients and trivial 
amounts (sometimes reffered to as window dressings) for 
the remainder of the ingredients.  

The purpose here is not to hold any particular company in 
judgement, but to demonstrate the difference between Renew 
and many of the products being bought by millions of 
unsuspecting people every day.  Renew contains less than 
100 milligrams (approximately) of fillers and each 
ingredient in Renew is, according to the most recent 
research studies, present in effective dosage levels . . . 
Not just window dressings.  That means that in that "00" 
{double ought} capsule that is capable of holding up to 
1000+ milligrams of material contains less than 100 
milligrams of filler.  There is over 1100 milligrams of
active ingredients in Renew.  Furthermore, if there are 
other products that can make this statement, I would like 
to see that people can still get a good deal.  The kind of 
deal where you really get what you paid for.
