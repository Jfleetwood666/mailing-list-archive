&gt;
&gt;In yesterday's mail I found a copy of a Cato Institute policy analysis by
&gt;Tim Lynch called "Dereliction of Duty: The Constitutional Record of
&gt;President Clinton." It's damming. Lynch lays bare Clinton's two-faced,
&gt;arrogant, downright hostile attitude towards civil liberties and, in a
&gt;word, freedom.
&gt;
&gt;Lynch concludes: "If constitutional report cards were handed out to
&gt;presidents, Bill Clinton would certainly receive an F--an appalling grade
&gt;for any president--let alone a former professor of constitutional law."
&gt;I've attached a few excerpts below.
&gt;
&gt;Also, in today's mail came a new book put out by Cato, "The Future of
&gt;Money in the Information Age," edited by James Dorn. I haven't read it
&gt;yet, but it looks promising.

&gt;
&gt;DERELICTION OF DUTY
&gt;The Constitutional Record of President Clinton
&gt;
&gt;by Timothy Lynch
&gt;
&gt;Timothy Lynch is assistant director of the Cato
&gt;Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies.
&gt;
&gt;*********
&gt;
&gt;Executive Summary
&gt;
&gt;President Clinton recently put his hand on the Bible
&gt;and swore an oath to "preserve, protect and defend the
&gt;Constitution of the United States." He took the same
&gt;oath in January 1993. As the president embarks on his
&gt;second term in office, it is an appropriate time to
&gt;review his record thus far to see how well he has
&gt;defended our Constitution.
&gt;
&gt;Although President Clinton has expressed support for
&gt;an "expansive" view of the Constitution and the Bill
&gt;of Rights, he has actually weakened a number of
&gt;fundamental guarantees, including those of free speech
&gt;and the right to trial by jury and that against double
&gt;jeopardy. He has also supported retroactive taxes, gun
&gt;control, and warrantless searches and seizures. The
&gt;president's legal team is constantly pushing for
&gt;judicial rulings that will sanction expansions of
&gt;federal power. The Clinton White House has, for
&gt;example, supported the federalization of health care,
&gt;crime fighting, environmental protection, and
&gt;education. Clinton also claims constitutional
&gt;authority to order military attacks against other
&gt;countries whenever he deems it appropriate. President
&gt;Clinton's record is, in a word, deplorable. If
&gt;constitutional report cards were handed out to
&gt;presidents, he would receive an F.
&gt;
&gt;It is to be hoped that President Clinton will resolve
&gt;to be more conscientious about his constitutional
&gt;responsibilities in his second term. But should his
&gt;dereliction of duty continue, Congress and the Supreme
&gt;Court should stand fast against any constitutional
&gt;transgression. In the present climate, it is vitally
&gt;important for all Americans to understand that the
&gt;Constitution is incapable of enforcing itself. That
&gt;task ultimately rests with the citizenry. If the
&gt;American people demand adherence to the Constitution,
&gt;government officials, including President Clinton,
&gt;will respect the limitations that were wisely placed
&gt;on their power.
&gt;
&gt;*********
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The Free Speech Clause
&gt;
&gt;The free speech clause of the First Amendment is,
&gt;without a doubt, the most famous provision of the
&gt;American Constitution. Its simple, yet profound,
&gt;command provides: "Congress shall pass no law . . .
&gt;abridging the freedom of speech." The underlying
&gt;principle of the free speech clause is that "each
&gt;person should decide for him or herself the ideas and
&gt;beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and
&gt;adherence." [9] That principle has been recognized as
&gt;"one of the preeminent rights of Western democratic
&gt;theory, the touchstone of individual liberty." [10]
&gt;The invocation of the free speech guarantee, however,
&gt;is often controversial because it requires the
&gt;government and the citizenry to tolerate the speech
&gt;and writings of unpopular, crude, ignorant, and
&gt;malicious people. Civil libertarians must often remind
&gt;government officials (and others) that if the First
&gt;Amendment only protected the expression of popular and
&gt;agreeable ideas, it would be totally unnecessary since
&gt;those ideas would never be threatened by our
&gt;democratic form of government. Our society's
&gt;commitment to free speech is tested when we encounter
&gt;the expression of ideas that are disagreeable--or even
&gt;offensive.
&gt;
&gt;One would think that President Clinton, a former
&gt;professor of constitutional law, would have a deep
&gt;appreciation for the principle of freedom of speech,
&gt;but his official actions in office show just the
&gt;opposite. The Clinton Justice Department has attempted
&gt;to censor (a) the rights of peaceful protesters; (b)
&gt;the views of priests and doctors; (c) radio,
&gt;television, and the Internet; and (d) truthful
&gt;advertisements for lawful products.
&gt;
&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;The Ex Post Facto Clause
&gt;
&gt;The Framers of the Constitution detested the idea of
&gt;retroactive legislation. The Constitution contains two
&gt;specific prohibitions against ex post facto laws:
&gt;Article I, section 9, addresses Congress: "No . . . ex
&gt;post facto Law shall be passed." Article I, section
&gt;10, addresses state officials: "No State shall pass
&gt;any ex post facto Law." The Constitution contains no
&gt;exception to either prohibition. As Professor William
&gt;Winslow Crosskey of the University of Chicago once
&gt;observed, it is evident that ex post facto laws "were
&gt;thoroughly disapproved by the framers of the
&gt;Constitution and intended by them to be completely
&gt;impossible under our system." [44]
&gt;
&gt;Not only has President Clinton failed to defend the
&gt;prohibition of ex post facto laws; he encouraged the
&gt;103rd Congress to violate the prohibition. In the
&gt;summer of 1993 he urged Congress to levy a retroactive
&gt;tax on the American people. Under the president's
&gt;initial budget plan, income, corporate, gift, and
&gt;estate taxes were to be increased retroactively to
&gt;January 1, 1993--20 days before the president assumed
&gt;office. Never before in American history had a tax
&gt;been made retroactive to the time of a prior
&gt;administration.
&gt;
&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;The Warrant Clause
&gt;
&gt;The warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment, specifying
&gt;the conditions that must be met before officials may
&gt;search a person's home or seize papers and effects,
&gt;provides: "no [search] Warrants shall issue, but upon
&gt;probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
&gt;particularly describing the place to be searched, and
&gt;the person or things to be seized." The warrant clause
&gt;protects the citizenry from arbitrary searches by
&gt;requiring law enforcement personnel to obtain judicial
&gt;authorization before they demand entrance to any
&gt;person's home. The Supreme Court described the
&gt;constitutional importance of the warrant application
&gt;process in McDonald v. United States (1948).
&gt;
&gt;The presence of a search warrant serves a high
&gt;function. Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth
&gt;Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the
&gt;citizen and the police. This was done not to shield
&gt;criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for
&gt;illegal activities. It was done so that an objective
&gt;mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in
&gt;order to enforce the law. The right of privacy was
&gt;deemed too precious to entrust to the discretion of
&gt;those whose job is the detection and the arrest of
&gt;criminals. Power is a heady thing; and history shows
&gt;that the police acting on their own cannot be trusted.
&gt;And so the Constitution requires a magistrate to pass
&gt;on the desires of the police before they violate the
&gt;privacy of the home. [50]
&gt;
&gt;The Clinton administration has repeatedly attempted to
&gt;play down the significance of the warrant clause. In
&gt;fact, President Clinton has asserted the power to
&gt;conduct warrantless searches, warrantless drug testing
&gt;of public school students, and warrantless
&gt;wiretapping.
&gt;
&gt;Warrantless "National Security" Searches
&gt;
&gt;The Clinton administration claims that it can bypass
&gt;the warrant clause for "national security" purposes.
&gt;In July 1994 Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick
&gt;told the House Select Committee on Intelligence that
&gt;the president "has inherent authority to conduct
&gt;warrantless searches for foreign intelligence
&gt;purposes." [51] According to Gorelick, the president
&gt;(or his attorney general) need only satisfy himself
&gt;that an American is working in conjunction with a
&gt;foreign power before a search can take place.
&gt;
&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;Constitutional Federalism
&gt;
&gt;President Clinton is the first president in American
&gt;history to deny that the Constitution limits the
&gt;powers of the federal government. The Clinton White
&gt;House has sought to federalize health care, crime
&gt;fighting, environmental protection, and education. It
&gt;has also tried to thwart any effort to downsize
&gt;federal agencies and programs. Although the Washington
&gt;press corps has dutifully scrutinized the fledgling
&gt;efforts of the 104th Congress to breathe life into the
&gt;Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, which affirms
&gt;that the federal government has only limited powers,
&gt;the president's efforts to expand federal power have
&gt;received scant attention from a Tenth Amendment
&gt;perspective. By his official conduct as president,
&gt;Clinton has made it clear that he believes there is no
&gt;area of human activity that is beyond the
&gt;redistributive or regulatory reach of the federal
&gt;government and that the state governments essentially
&gt;operate at the sufferance of the national government.
&gt;Such a view contravenes the text, history, and
&gt;structure of our Constitution.
&gt;
&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;Conclusion
&gt;
&gt;As his first term of office drew to a close, Bill
&gt;Clinton proclaimed, "One of my highest goals as
&gt;President has been . . . to protect and uphold the
&gt;Constitution." [161] In light of the evidence set
&gt;forth in this study, it seems obvious that that
&gt;statement was simply a platitudinous throwaway line
&gt;that was completely devoid of substance.
&gt;
&gt;Supporters of the Clinton White House can point with
&gt;pride to a handful of presidential actions in defense
&gt;of constitutional rights--such as the signing of the
&gt;Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Justice
&gt;Department's lawsuit against the Virginia Military
&gt;Institute on behalf of gender equality [162]--but
&gt;those acts were exceptions to the rule. Indeed, some
&gt;constitutionalists and civil liberties attorneys might
&gt;very well claim that this study does not go far enough
&gt;in its criticisms of the Clinton record. [163]
&gt;Although this study is not an exhaustive account of
&gt;every presidential action over the last four years, it
&gt;does present overwhelming evidence that Clinton has
&gt;been derelict in his duty to "protect and preserve"
&gt;our Constitution. If constitutional report cards were
&gt;handed out to presidents, Bill Clinton would certainly
&gt;receive an F--an appalling grade for any
&gt;president--let alone a former professor of
&gt;constitutional law.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps Clinton will resolve to be more conscientious
&gt;about his constitutional responsibilities in his
&gt;second term. One can only hope that he will. But
&gt;should his dereliction of duty continue, Congress and
&gt;the Supreme Court should stand fast against any
&gt;constitutional transgression.
&gt;
&gt;All three branches of government--executive,
&gt;legislative, and judicial--should strive to be more
&gt;conscientious about meeting the responsibilities that
&gt;have been assigned to them under the Constitution.
&gt;Constitutional violations are frequently temporary,
&gt;isolated events. The most serious constitutional
&gt;violations occur when all three branches conspire to
&gt;expand the bounds of government power. When that
&gt;happens, it becomes very difficult to right the wrong.
&gt;Precedents are extremely important. That is why any
&gt;constitutional transgression by any branch is
&gt;alarming.
&gt;
&gt;The American people should jealously guard their
&gt;liberty and hold all government officials accountable
&gt;when they neglect or disregard the Constitution. Its
&gt;Framers were keenly aware that the ultimate source of
&gt;the Constitution's authority is the consent of the
&gt;people. If the American electorate demands adherence
&gt;to the Bill of Rights and the other provisions of our
&gt;Constitution, government officials will respect the
&gt;constitutional limitations on their power. But, as
&gt;Judge Learned Hand warned many years ago, "Liberty
&gt;lies in the hearts of men and women; [if] it dies
&gt;there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it."
