I forwarded Mr. May's post to a buddy of mine, Ronald Carrier, who is 
getting his Piled Higher and Deeper in Continental Philosophy. I asked 
for comments, and recieved permission to forward his comments to the 
list. Here it is:

Forwarded message:
&gt; From rcarrier@suba.com  Sat Apr 19 18:02:57 1997
&gt; From: "Ronald M. Carrier" &lt;rcarrier@suba.com&gt;
&gt; Good afternoon.
&gt; Thanks for forwarding this to me.  I've taken a look at it, and it seems 
&gt; to me to be a good introductory indication of what Nietzsche was up to.  
&gt; There are just three points on which I'd like to offer a bit of 
&gt; clarification.
&gt; 
&gt; (1) Nietzsche as "anti-systematic" thinker: this is something that is 
&gt; also referred to when Nietzsche is called a "perspectival" thinker.  
&gt; Nietzsche thinks that thinking was an activity that is ultimately in the 
&gt; service of life, where "life" is a process of discovering and developing 
&gt; one's capacities for acting to the fullest.  (And on this understanding 
&gt; of life, thinking would itself be one of these capacities for acting.)  
&gt; For Nietzsche, to develop a system is to develop a perspective, and so to 
&gt; develop a certain way of living.  Indeed, he regards systems primarily as 
&gt; _symptoms_ of various ways of living.
&gt; 
&gt; What he dislikes about systems is that they are perspectives that are, so 
&gt; to speak, monopolistic--they are ways of thinking (and, in the end, ways 
&gt; of living) to which everyone must submit themselves and which deny that 
&gt; there are other ways of thinking and living that may be better suited for 
&gt; someone.  Nietzsche is anti-system in that he thinks that life is best 
&gt; served if one is able to develop in oneself the capacity for multiple 
&gt; perspectives, multiple ways of thinking and living.  Nietzsche himself 
&gt; attempts to do this in his own writing--hence the aphoristic style of 
&gt; which he was fond.  (This is not to say that Nietzsche was not capable of 
&gt; developing a sustained argument--_On_the_Genealogy_of_Morals_ does 
&gt; precisely this.)
&gt; 
&gt; For Nietzsche, thinking best serves life and is symptomatic of life at 
&gt; its best (i.e. a life that is active and deals creatively with the 
&gt; circumstances that chance throws up for it, rather than one that is 
&gt; reactive and tries to minimize the role of chance and change in living) 
&gt; if it is the interplay of as many different perspectives as one can handle.
&gt; 
&gt; (2) Nietzsche and evolution: I think it's good that the author pointed 
&gt; out the connections that can be made between Nietzsche and contemporary 
&gt; evolutionary biology.  Nietzsche did not think much of Darwin, but this 
&gt; is not so much because he disagreed with what Darwin wrote (I'm not sure 
&gt; whether he had read Darwin himself or not) as because he disagreed with 
&gt; what others tended to make of what Darwin wrote (or what they supposed he 
&gt; wrote).  Nietzsche disagrees, not with Darwin's notion of natural 
&gt; selection, but with the popular notion of evolution (a notion which 
&gt; Darwin did not himself employ in his works).
&gt; 
&gt; "Evolution" presupposes that what organisms there are and what they are 
&gt; like is something that is predetermined and that inexorably unfolds 
&gt; across time.  Natural selection, even in Darwin, is incompatible with 
&gt; evolution in this sense because natural selection posits chance and 
&gt; change as both ineliminable and necessary to the process of speciation.  
&gt; And as I pointed out above, Nietzsche thinks that chance and change are 
&gt; ineliminable from life and necessary for the development of life at its 
&gt; best.  "Evolution" also involves the idea that there is some one best way 
&gt; of life that is the unavoidable outcome of evolution, namely whatever way 
&gt; of being human that the "evolutionary" thinker thinks is best.  This is 
&gt; for Nietzsche a reactive way of thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; But while Nietzsche's way of thinking is compatible with contemporary 
&gt; evolutionary biology, I think it's misleading to claim that his 
&gt; understanding of life is "biological."  Nietzsche thinks that biology 
&gt; plays an ineliminable and necessary part in life, but he also thinks that 
&gt; life is more than just a matter of biology.  (Nietzsche was suspicious of 
&gt; science because he thought that it too aspired to be a system in the 
&gt; sense of a monopolistic perspective.  In other words, he disliked scientism.)
&gt; 
&gt; (3) Authoritarian v. libertarian: The author claims that these are 
&gt; contradictory positions in Nietzsche.  I don't think they are.  They 
&gt; would be contradictory if Nietzsche held that everybody was equally 
&gt; capable of attaining to life at its best.  Nietzsche is _very_ clear in 
&gt; his denial of this.  He thinks that reactive thinking and living is 
&gt; typical of the great mass of people and suitable for them.  They are able 
&gt; to live as well as they do precisely because a confinement to one 
&gt; perspective suits them--expose them to the possibility that their 
&gt; perspective is not suitable for all, and they will fall into despair 
&gt; (because from their perspective the way of life they lead must be 
&gt; suitable either for all or for none).
&gt; 
&gt; Only a very few are, in Nietzsche's view, capable of thinking and living 
&gt; actively.  Insofar as the ideal political arrangement would be one that 
&gt; would discover and cultivate these active few and put them in positions 
&gt; where they could do their best, while letting everybody else get along 
&gt; more or less as their reactive lives permit, it would be libertarian for 
&gt; the best and authoritarian for the rest.  To the extent that 
&gt; libertarianism presupposes equality of nature, Nietzsche is not a 
&gt; libertarian; to the extent that authoritarianism is based on a reactive 
&gt; way of life to which both master and slave are beholden, Nietzsche is not 
&gt; an authoritarian.  His politics are, if anything, those of Aristotle in 
&gt; the _Politics_.  (This is not terribly surprising--Nietzsche was a 
&gt; philologist by training and so had a wide familiarity with ancient Greek 
&gt; writings.)
&gt; 
&gt; HTH.
