&gt;    
&gt;    Quotes from F.A. Hayek
&gt;    
&gt;     [IMAGE] 
&gt;    
&gt;     1. Should our moral beliefs really prove to be dependent on factual
&gt;        assumptions shown to be incorrect, it would be hardly moral to
&gt;        defend them by refusing to acknowledge the facts.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;     2. Ever since the beginning of modern science, the best minds have
&gt;        recognized that "the range of acknowledged ignorance will grow
&gt;        with the advance of science." Unfortunately, the popular effect of
&gt;        this scientific advance has been a belief, seemingly shared by
&gt;        many scientists, that the range of our ignorance is steadily
&gt;        diminishing and that we can therefore aim at more comprehensive
&gt;        and deliberate control of all human activities. It is for this
&gt;        reason that those intoxicated by the advance of knowledge so often
&gt;        become the enemies of freedom.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;     3. Humiliating to human pride as it may be, we must recognize that
&gt;        the advance and even the preservation of civilization are
&gt;        dependent upon a maximum of opportunity for accidents to happen.
&gt;        [The Constitution of Liberty, ch. 2.4
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;     4. All political theories assume, of course, that most individuals
&gt;        are very ignorant. Those who plead for liberty differ from the
&gt;        rest in that they include among the ignorant themselves as well as
&gt;        the wisest.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;     5. Compared with the totality of knowledge which is continually
&gt;        utilized in the evolution of a dynamic civilization, the
&gt;        difference between the knowledge that the wisest and that which
&gt;        the most ignorant individual can deliberately employ is
&gt;        comparatively insignificant.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;     6. Equality of the general rules of law and conduct, however, is the
&gt;        only kind of equality conducive to liberty and the only equality
&gt;        which we can secure without destroying liberty. Not only has
&gt;        liberty nothing to do with any other sort of equality, but it is
&gt;        even bound to produce inequality in many respects. This is the
&gt;        necessary result and part of the justification of individual
&gt;        liberty: if the result of individual liberty did not demonstrate
&gt;        that some manners of living are more successful than others, much
&gt;        of the case for it would vanish.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;     7. From the fact that people are very different it follows that, if
&gt;        we treat them equally, the result must be inequality in their
&gt;        actual position, and that the only way to place them in an equal
&gt;        position would be to treat them differently. Equality before the
&gt;        law and material equality are therefore not only different but are
&gt;        in conflict which each other; and we can achieve either one or the
&gt;        other, but not both at the same time.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;     8. However human, envy is certainly not one of the sources of
&gt;        discontent that a free society can eliminate. It is probably one
&gt;        of the essential conditions for the preservation of such a society
&gt;        that we do not countenance envy, not sanction its demands by
&gt;        camouflaging it as social justice, but treat it, in the words of
&gt;        John Stuart Mill, as "the most anti-social and evil of all
&gt;        passions.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;     9. Justice, like liberty and coercion, is a concept which, for the
&gt;        sake of clarity, ought to be confined to the deliberate treatment
&gt;        of men by other men.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    10. ...whenever it is necessary that one of several conflicting
&gt;        opinions should prevail and when one would have to be made to
&gt;        prevail by force if need be, it is less wasteful to determine
&gt;        which has the stronger support by counting numbers than by
&gt;        fighting. Democracy is the only method of peaceful change that man
&gt;        has yet been discovered.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    11. The conception that government should be guided by majority
&gt;        opinion makes sense only if that opinion is independent of
&gt;        government. The ideal of democracy rests on the belief that the
&gt;        view which will direct government emerges from an independent and
&gt;        spontaneous process. It requires, therefore, the existence of a
&gt;        large sphere independent of majority control in which the opinions
&gt;        of the individuals are formed.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    12. It is only because the majority opinion will always be opposed by
&gt;        some that our knowledge and understanding progress. In the process
&gt;        by which opinion is formed, it is very probable that, by the time
&gt;        any view becomes a majority view, it is no longer the best view:
&gt;        somebody will already have advanced beyond the point which the
&gt;        majority have reached. It is because we do not yet which of the
&gt;        many competing new opinions will prove itself the best that we
&gt;        wait until it has gained sufficient support.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    13. ...it is always from a minority acting in ways different from what
&gt;        the majority would prescribe that the majority in the end learns
&gt;        to do better.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    14. The successful politician owes his power to the fact that he moves
&gt;        within the accepted framework of thought, that he thinks and talks
&gt;        conventionally. It would be almost a contradiction in terms for a
&gt;        politician to be a leader in the field of ideas. His task in a
&gt;        democracy is to find out what the opinions held by the largest
&gt;        number are, not to give currency to new opinions which may become
&gt;        the majority view in some distant future.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    15. What a free society offers to the individual is much more than
&gt;        what he would be able to do if only he were free.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    16. Perhaps the fact that we have seen millions voting themselves into
&gt;        complete dependence on a tyrant has made our generation understand
&gt;        that to choose one's government is not necessarily to secure
&gt;        freedom.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    17. Human reason can neither predict nor deliberately shape its own
&gt;        future. Its advances consist in finding out where it has been
&gt;        wrong.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    18. A society that does not recognize that each individual has values
&gt;        of his own which he is entitled to follow can have no respect for
&gt;        the dignity of the individual and cannot really know freedom.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    19. Liberty is an opportunity for doing good, but this is only so when
&gt;        it is also an opportunity for doing wrong.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    20. ...if we wish to preserve a free society, it is essential that we
&gt;        recognize that the desirability of a particular object is not
&gt;        sufficient justification for the use of coercion.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    21. ...it is largely because civilization enables us constantly to
&gt;        profit from knowledge which we individually do not possess and
&gt;        because each individual's use of his particular knowledge may
&gt;        serve to assist others unknown to him in achieving their ends that
&gt;        men as members of civilized society can pursue their individual
&gt;        ends so much more successfully than they could alone.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    22. The mind cannot foresee its own advance.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    23. Every change in conditions will make necessary some change in the
&gt;        use of resources, in the direction and kind of human activities,
&gt;        in habits and practices. And each change in the actions of those
&gt;        affected in the first instance will require further adjustments
&gt;        that will gradually extend through the whole of society. Every
&gt;        change thus in a sense creates a "problem" for society, even
&gt;        though no single individual perceives it as such; it is gradually
&gt;        "solved" by the establishment of a new overall adjustment.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    24. ...the case for individual freedom rests largely on the
&gt;        recognition of the inevitable and universal ignorance of all of us
&gt;        concerning a great many of the factors on which the achievements
&gt;        of our ends and welfare depend.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    25. ...the ultimate decision about what is accepted as right and wrong
&gt;        will be made not by individual human wisdom but by the
&gt;        disappearance of the groups that have adhered to the "wrong"
&gt;        beliefs.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    26. ...the argument for liberty is not an argument against
&gt;        organization, which is one of the most powerful tools human reason
&gt;        can employ, but an argument against all exclusive, privileged,
&gt;        monopolistic organization, against the use of coercion to prevent
&gt;        others from doing better.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    27. Even more significant of the inherent weakness of the collectivist
&gt;        theories is the extraordinary paradox that from the assertion that
&gt;        society is in some sense more than merely the aggregate of all
&gt;        individuals their adherents regularly pass by a sort of
&gt;        intellectual somersault to the thesis that in order that the
&gt;        coherence of this larger entity be safeguarded it must be
&gt;        subjected to conscious control, that is, to the control of what in
&gt;        the last resort must be an individual mind. It thus comes about
&gt;        that in practice it is regularly the theoretical collectivist who
&gt;        extols individual reason and demands that all forces of society be
&gt;        made subject to the direction of a single mastermind, while it is
&gt;        the individualist who recognizes the limitations of the powers of
&gt;        individual reason and consequently advocates freedom as a means
&gt;        for the fullest development of the powers of the interindividual
&gt;        process.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    28. It may indeed prove to be far the most difficult and not the least
&gt;        important task for human reason rationally to comprehend its own
&gt;        limitations. It is essential for the growth of reason that as
&gt;        individuals we should bow to forces and obey principles which we
&gt;        cannot hope fully to understand, yet on which the advance and even
&gt;        the preservation of civilization depend.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    29. The discussions of every age are filled with the issues on which
&gt;        its leading schools of thought differ. But the general
&gt;        intellectual atmosphere of the time is always determined by the
&gt;        views on which the opposing schools agree. They become the
&gt;        unspoken presuppositions of all thought, and common and
&gt;        unquestioningly accepted foundations on which all discussion
&gt;        proceeds.
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;        
&gt;    30. From the saintly and single-minded idealist to the fanatic is
&gt;        often but a step.
&gt;
