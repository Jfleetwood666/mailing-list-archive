An Important Recent Letter from Congressman Ron Paul (Texas):

Please forward freely!

- ----------------------

Congressman Ron Paul

House of Representatives
203 Cannon
Washington D.C.  20515

TEL 202-225-2831
FAX 202-226-4871


Dear Friend:

     The other day, I made a huge "gaffe" on national TV:  I told the truth
about the crimes of the U.S. government.  As you can imagine, the ceiling
fell in, and a couple of walls too.

     Congressmen are supposed to support the government, I was told.  Oh,
it's okay to criticize around the edges, but there are certain subjects a
member of the House of Representatives is not supposed to bring up.  But I
touched the real "third-rail" of American politics, and the sparks sure
flew.

     I was interviewed on C-SPAN's morning "Washington Journal," and I used
the opportunity, as I do all such media appearances, to point out how many
of our liberties have been stolen by the federal government.  We must take
them back.

     The Constitution, after all, has a VERY limited role for Washington,
D.C.  If we stuck to the Constitution as written, we would have: no federal
meddling in our schools;  no Federal Reserve;  no U.S. membership in the
UN;  no gun control;  and no foreign aid.

     We would have no welfare for big corporations, or the "poor"; no
American troops in 100 foreign countries;  no Nafta, Gatt, or "fast-track";
no arrogant federal judges usurping states rights;  no attacks on private
property;  and no income tax.

     We could get rid of most of the cabinet departments, most of the
agencies, and most of the budget.  The government would be small, frugal,
and limited.

     That system is called liberty.  It's what the Founding Fathers gave
us.  Under liberty, we built the greatest, freest, most prosperous, most
decent country on earth.

     It's no coincidence that the monstrous growth of the federal
government has been accompanied by a sickening decline in living standards
and moral standards.

     The feds want us to be hamsters on a treadmill -- working hard, all
day long, to pay high taxes, but otherwise entirely docile and controlled.
The huge, expensive, and out-of-control leviathan that we call the federal
government wants to run every single aspect of our lives.

[Page 2]

     Well, I'm sorry, but that's not America.  It's not what the Founders
gave us.  It's not the country you believe in.  It's not the country I
believe in.

     So, on that TV interview, I emphasized not only the attacks on our
property, but also the decline of our civil liberties, at the hands of the
federal police.  There are not supposed to be ANY federal police, according
to the Constitution.

     Then I really went over the line.  I talked about the Waco massacre.
Bill Clinton and Janet Reno claim those 81 church members, including 19
children, burned down their own church and killed themselves, and good
riddance.  So they put the few survivors on trial, and threw them in prison
for 40 years.

     We're not supposed to remember that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms -- talk about an unconstitutional agency -- rather than arrest
David Koresh on his regular morning jog,  called in the TV stations for a
big publicity bonanza, and sent a swat team in black masks and black
uniforms to break down his front door, guns blazing.  They also sent in a
helicopter gunship, to shoot at the roof of a church full of innocents.

     The Branch Davidians resisted, and after a heartless siege of almost
two months, and after cutting off food, water, and electricity, and playing
horrible rock and roll through huge speakers 24 hours a day, the feds sent
in the tanks to crush the walls of the church, and inject poisonous CS gas.

     Now, CS gas is banned under the Paris Convention on Chemical Warfare.
The U.S. could not use it in a war.  But it could and did use it against
American civilians.

     After the tanks did their work on the church, the place burst into
flame, and all 81 people -- men, women, children, and babies--were
incinerated in a screaming horror.

     Did some feds set the fire?  Did the flammable CS gas ignite, since
without electricity, the parishioners were using lanterns?  Did a tank
knock over a lantern, striking one of the bales of hay being used against
the thin walls as a "defense" against bullets?  or did the Davidians, as
Clinton and Reno claim, kill themselves?

     A new documentary -- Waco: The Rules of Engagement -- may show,
through FLIR infrared photography, FBI snipers killing the Davidians by
shooting through the back of the church, where no media cameras were
allowed.  This film won a prize at the famed Sundance Film Festival.  It
was made by people who took the government's side, until they investigated.

     Whatever the truth, there's no question that an irresponsible federal
government has innocent blood on its

[Page 3]

hands, and not only from Waco.  And the refusal of corrupt and perverse
liberals to admit it means nothing.

     In my TV interview, in answer to a caller's question, I pointed out
that Waco, and the federal murders at Ruby Ridge -- especially the FBI
sniper's shot that blasted apart the head of a young mother holding her
baby -- caused many Americans to live in fear of federal power.

     Then I uttered the sentiment that caused the media hysteria:  I said
that a lot of Americans fear that they too might be attacked by federal
swat teams for exercising their constitutional rights, or merely for
wanting to be left alone.

     Whoa!  You've never seen anything like it. For days, in an all-out
assault, I was attacked by Democrats, unions, big business, establishment
Republicans, and -- of course -- the media, in Washington and my home state
of Texas.  Newspapers foamed at the mouth, calling me a "right-wing
extremist."  (Say, isn't that what George III called Thomas Jefferson?)

     I was even blamed for the Oklahoma City bombing!  And by the way, I
don't believe we've gotten the full truth on that either.

     All my many opponents were outraged that a Congressman would criticize
big government.  "If you don't like Washington, resign!" said a typical
big-city newspaper editorial. But the media, as usual, were all wet. (Do
they ever get ANYTHING right?)

     The average Congressman may go to Washington to wallow in power, and
line his pockets with a big lobbying job for a special interest (so he can
keep ripping-off the taxpayers).

     But that's not why I'm in Congress.  It's not why I left my medical
practice as a physician.  It's not why I put up with all the abuse.  It's
not why I refuse a plush Congressional pension.

     I'm in this fight for a reason.  I want to hand on to my children and
grandchildren, and to you and your family, a great and free America, an
America true to her Constitution, an America worthy of her history.  I will
not let the crooks and clowns and criminals have their way.

     I'm in Congress to represent the ideas of liberty, the ideas that you
and I share, for the people of my district, for the people of Texas, for
the people of America.  That's why I'm working to stop federal abuses, and
to cut the government:  its taxes, its bureaucrats, its paramilitary
police, its spending, its meddling overseas, and every single
unconstitutional action it takes.  And not with a pair of nail scissors,
but with a hammer and chisel.  Won't you help me do this work?

     Not much of the federal leviathan would be left, if I

[Page 4]

had my way.  But you'd be able to keep the money you earn, your privacy
would be secure, your dollar would be sound, your local school would be
tops, and your kids wouldn't be sent off to some useless or vicious foreign
war to fight for the UN.  But Jefferson and the other Founders would
recognize our government, and our descendants would bless us.

     By the way, when I say cut taxes, I don't mean fiddle with the code.
I mean abolish the income tax and the IRS, and replace them with NOTHING.

     Recently, I asked a famous Republican committee chairman -- who's
always talking about getting rid of the IRS -- why he engineered a secret
$580 million raise for the tax collectors.  "They need it for their
computers," this guy told me.  So the IRS can't extract enough from us as
it is!

     The National Taxpayers Union says I have the highest pro-taxpayer
rating in Congressional history, that I am the top "Taxpayer's Best
Friend."  You know I won't play the Capitol Hill games with the Capitol
Hill gang, denouncing the IRS while giving the gestapo more of your money.
or figuring out some other federal tax for them to squeeze out of you.

     I also want to abolish the Federal Reserve, and send Alan Greenspan
out to get a job.  The value of our dollar and the level of our interest
rates are not supposed to be manipulated by a few members of the power
elite meeting secretly in a marble palace.

     The Federal Reserve is unconstitutional, pure and simple.  The only
Constitutional money is gold and silver, and notes redeemable in them.  Not
Fed funny money.

     Without the Federal Reserve, our money could not be inflated, at the
behest of big government or big banks. Your income and savings would not
lose their value.  Just as important, we wouldn't have this endless string
of booms and busts, recessions and depressions, with each bust getting
worse.  They aren't natural to the free market; they're caused by the
schemers at the Fed.

     President Andrew Jackson called the 19th-century Fed "The Monster"
because it was a vehicle for inflation and all sorts of special-interest
corruption.  Let me tell you, things haven't changed a bit.

     I also work to save our schools from D.C. interference.  Thanks to the
feds, new curriculums not only smear the Founders as "racist, slave-owning
elitists," they seek to dumb down our students so they will all be equal.
"Look-say" reading and the abolition of phonics has the same purpose, and
so does the new "fuzzy" math, in which there are no right and no wrong
answers.

     That must be what they use in the U.S. Treasury!  It's certainly what
they use in the U.S. Congress.

[Page 5]

     But ever since the beginning of federal aid to education and
accelerating with the establishment of the rotten Department of Education,
SAT scores have been dropping. Schools, with few exceptions, are getting
worse every year.

     To save our kids, we must get the sticky fingers of the feds off our
local schools, and let parents rule.  That's what the Constitution says,
and the Bible too.

     And then there's my least favorite foreign topic, the UN. World
government is obviously unconstitutional.  It undermines our country's
sovereignty in the worst way possible.  That's why I want us out of the UN,
and the UN itself taking a hike.

     After all, the UN is socialist and corrupt (many votes can be bought
with a "blonde and a case of scotch," one UN ambassador once said).  It
costs many billions, and it puts our soldiers in UN uniforms under foreign
commanders, and sends them off to unconstitutional, undeclared wars.  When
Michael New, one of the finest young men I've ever met, objected to wearing
UN blue, he was kicked out of the American Army.  What an outrage.

     Not one dime for the UN, and not one American soldier!  Not in Haiti,
not in Bosnia, not in Somalia, not in Rwanda.  I know it's radical, but how
about devoting American military efforts to defending America, and only
America?

     Such ideas, said one newspaper reporter, make me a "maverick who will
never go far because he won't 'go along to get along.'"  Darn right.  What
does "go far" mean?  Get a big government job?  The heck with that.  And I
won't sell my vote for pork either.

     When I walked through the U.S. Capitol this morning, I got angry.  The
building is filled with statues and paintings of Jefferson, Madison, and
the other Founders.  Those great men sacrificed everything to give us a
free country, and a Constitution to keep it that way.

     When I was first elected, I placed my hand on the Bible and swore an
oath to uphold the Constitution.  That's exactly what I'm fighting for.
But such ideas drive the liberals crazy.  That's why I badly need your
help.

     I've been targeted nationally for defeat.  The Democrats, the AFL-CIO,
the teachers union, big business PACs, the trial lawyers, the big bankers,
the foreign-aid .lobbyists, the big media, and the establishment
Republicans want to dance on my political grave.  The Fed, the Education
Department, and the UN are anxious to join in.  They can't stand even one
person telling the truth.  And they're terrified when that truth gains the
people's support.

     Right now, four well-funded Democrats are competing to try to beat me,
and a Republican is rumored to have been

[Page 6]

offered money at a secret meeting in Mexico(!) if he would try to knock me
off in a primary.

     Won't you help me stay up here to fight? Frankly, I'm in trouble if
you don't.

     My Texas district has 22,000 square miles (not a misprint). I've got
to travel all over it, set up small offices to be manned by volunteers,
advertise, pay phone bills, and distribute video and audio tapes to the
people to get around the big-media lies.  As I know from my last election,
which I won by the skin of my teeth, the media will carry any smear, repeat
any libel, throw any piece of mud, no matter how untrue.  In fact, the less
true, the more they like it.

     They are determined to silence me.  But you can help me overcome all
this.  Together, we can beat the bad guys arrayed against our country and
our freedom.  We can support the Constitution.  We CAN win.

     Your generous contribution of $25 or $50 would be great.  $100, $250,
or even $500 or $1,000 would be magnificent.  Of course, any amount would
help, and in return, I will keep you up-to-date on this fight as a member
of my "kitchen cabinet."

     What great men founded this country.  What great people have carried
on their fight.  That fight is not lost, not if you will join it.
Washington, D.C., is a loser, but among the people, our ideas are gaining
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

     Keep the tide turning in our direction.  Please make your most
generous contribution.  Join this fight for the Constitution, and stop
those who want to rip it up, and throw it in the Potomac.  Together, we can
join the Founders, fight. Together, we can make history.


Sincerely,

/s/ - Ron

Ron Paul
U.S. Congressman

P.S.

Without you, I may be lost, and they'll be breaking out the champagne in
D.C. PLEASE, DON'T LET THIS FIGHT FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND LIBERTY FALTER.
HELP ME WIN IT.
