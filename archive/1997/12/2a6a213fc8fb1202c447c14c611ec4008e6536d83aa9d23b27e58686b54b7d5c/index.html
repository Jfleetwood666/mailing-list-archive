&gt;Daily Telegraph  Connected Supplement 16th December 1997
&gt;
&gt;A European Commission report warns that the United States has developed an
&gt;extensive spying network on European Citizens and we should all be worried,
&gt;reports Simon Davies.
&gt;
&gt;A global electronic spy network that can eavesdrop on every telephone,email
&gt;and telex communication around the world will be officially acknowledged
&gt;for the first time in a European Commission report to be delivered this
&gt;week.
&gt;
&gt;The report - Assessing the Technologies of Political Control -- was com-
&gt;missioned last year by the Civil Liberties Committee of the European
&gt;Parliament. It contains details of a network of American-controlled spy
&gt;stations on British soil and around the world. that "routinely and
&gt;indiscriminately" monitors countless phone, fax and email messages.
&gt;
&gt;It states: "Within Europe all email telephone and fax communications are
&gt;routinely intercepted bv the United States Natiomnal Security Agency
&gt;transfering all target information from the European nmainland via the
&gt;strategic hub of London then by satellite to Fort Meade in Maryland via
&gt;the crucial hub at Menwith Hill" in Yorkshire.
&gt;
&gt;The report confirms for the first time the existence of a the secretive
&gt;Echelon system.
&gt;
&gt;Until now evidence of such astounding technology has been patchy and
&gt;anecdotal. But the report - to be discussed on Thursday by the committee
&gt;of the office of Science and Technology Assessment in Luxembourg - confirms
&gt;that the citizens of Britain and other European states are subject to an
&gt;intensity of surveillance far in excess of that imagined by most parlia-
&gt;ments. Its findings arc certain to excite the concern of MEPS.
&gt;
&gt;"The Echelon system forms part of the UKUSA system but unlike many of the
&gt;electronic spy sysfems developed during the Cold War, Echelon is designed
&gt;primarily for non- military targets: governments, organizations  and
&gt;businesses in virtually every country.
&gt;
&gt;"The Echelon system works by indiscriminately intercepting very large
&gt;quantities of communications and then siphoning out what is valuable using
&gt;artificial intelligence aids like MEMEX to find key words".
&gt;
&gt;According to the report, Echelon uses a number of national dictionaries
&gt;containing key words of interest to each country.
&gt;
&gt;For more than a decade, former agents of US, British. Canadian and New
&gt;Zealand national security agencies have claimed that the monitoring of
&gt;electronic communications has become endemic throughout the world. Rumours
&gt;have circulated that new technologies have been developed which have the
&gt;capability to search most of the world's telex, fax and enaail networks
&gt;for "keywords". Phone calls. they claim. can be automatically analysed for
&gt;key words.
&gt;
&gt;Former signals intelligence operatives have claimed that spy bases control
&gt;led by America have the ability to search nearly all data communications
&gt;for kev words. They claim that Echelon automatically analyses most email
&gt;messaging for "precursor". data which assists intelligence agencies to
&gt;determine targets. According to former Canadian Security Establishment
&gt;agent Mike Frost. a voice recognition system called Oratory has been used
&gt;for some years to intercept diplomatic calls.
&gt;
&gt;The driving force behind the report is Glyn Ford. Labour MEP for Greater
&gt;Manchester East. He believes the report is crucial to the future of civil
&gt;liberties in Europe.
&gt;
&gt;"In the civil liberties committee we spend a great deal of time debating
&gt;issues such as free movement, immigration and drugs. Technology always
&gt;sits at the centre of these discussions.
&gt;
&gt;"There are times in history when technology helps democratise, and times
&gt;when it helps centralise. This is a time of centralisation. The justice
&gt;and home affairs pillar of Europe has become more powerful without a
&gt;corresponding strengthening of civil liberties."
&gt;
&gt;The report recommnends a variety of measure for dealing with the increas-
&gt;ing power of the the technologies of surveilance being used at Menwith
&gt;Hill and other centres. It bluntlyy advises: "The European Parliament
&gt;should reject proposals from the United States for making private messages
&gt;via the global communications network Internet) accessible to US intelli-
&gt;gence agencies.
&gt;
&gt;The report also urges a fundamental review of the involvement of the
&gt;American NSA (National Security Agency in Europe, suggestng that the
&gt;activities be either scaled down, or become more open and accountable.
&gt;
&gt;Such concerns have been privately expressed by governments and MEPS since
&gt;the Cold War, but surveillance has continued to expand. US intelligence
&gt;activity in Britain has enjoyed a steady growth throughout the past two
&gt;decades. The principal motivation for this rush of development is the US
&gt;interest in commercial espionage. In the Fifties. during the development
&gt;of the 'special relationship'. between America and Britain, one US insti-
&gt;tution was singled out for special attention.
&gt;
&gt;The NSA, the world's biggest and most powerful signals intelligence organ-
&gt;isation. received approval to set up a network of spy stations throughout
&gt;Britain. "Their role was to provide military, diplomatic and economic
&gt;intelligelince by intercepting communications from throughout the Northern
&gt;Hemisphere.
&gt;
&gt;The NSA is one of the shadowiest of the shadowy US intelligence agencies.
&gt;Until a few years ago, it existence was a secret and its charter and any
&gt;mention of its duties are still classified. However, it does have a Web
&gt;site (www.nsa.gov:8080) in which it describes itself as being responsible
&gt;for the signals intelligence and communications security activities of
&gt;the US government.
&gt;
&gt;One of its bases, Menwith Hill, was to become the biggest spy station in
&gt;the world. Its ears - known as radomes - are capable of listening in to
&gt;vast chunks of the communications spectrum throughout Europe and the old
&gt;Soviet Union.
&gt;
&gt;In its first decade the base sucked data from cables and microwave links
&gt;running through a nearby Post Office Tower, but the communications revolu-
&gt;tions of the Seventies and Eighties gave the base a capability that even
&gt;its architects could scarcely have been able to imagine. With the creation
&gt;of Intelsat and digital telecomnunications, Menwith and other stations
&gt;developed the capability to eavesdrop on an extensive scale on fax, telex
&gt;and voice messages. Then. with the development of the Internet, electronic
&gt;mail and electronic commerce, the listening posts were able to increase
&gt;their monitoring capability to eavesdrop on an unprecedented spectrum (of
&gt;personal and business communications.
&gt;
&gt;This activitv has been all but ignored by Parliament. When Labour MEPS
&gt;raised questions about the activities of the NSA. the Government invoked
&gt;secrecy rules. It has been the same for for 40 Years.
&gt;
&gt;Glyn Ford hopes his report may be the first step in a long road to more
&gt;openness. "Some democratically elected body should surely have a right to
&gt;know at some level. At the monment that's nowhere.
