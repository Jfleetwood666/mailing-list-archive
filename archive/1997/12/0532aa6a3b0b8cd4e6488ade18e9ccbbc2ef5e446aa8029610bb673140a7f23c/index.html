Hello!


My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom, wife, and part-time accountant.
As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my account primarily 
for business.  I received what I assumed was this same e-mail countless times and
deleted it each time.

About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy subject line,
I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going to try this.  
I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong 
with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after 
receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail 
advertisements for me.  After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is 
to bulk e-mail for free! 

I was not prepared for the results.  Every day for the last six weeks, my P.O. 
box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an extra 
mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am stunned by all 
the money that keeps rolling in!

My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a substantial 
downpayment on a house.  Now, not only are we purchasing a house with 40% 
down, we're going to Venice, Italy to celebrate!

I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to 
eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your money!), 
you will make at least as much money as we did.  If you can open an envelope, 
remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the
bank. Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is.  If I can 
do this, so can you!

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.
It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research
and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods 
and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990's.
This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the
U.S., 20% (100,000)  made their fortune in the last several years in MLM.
Moreover, statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through
Multi-Level Marketing. 

The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers.  
Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and 
study to it.  

My name is Christopher Erickson.  Two years ago, the corporation I 
worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was 
eliminated.  After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my 
own business.  Over the past year, I incured many unforeseen 
financial problems.  I owed my family, friends and creditors over
$35,000.  The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just
couldn't seem to make ends meet.  I had to refinance and borrow 
against my home to support my family and struggling business.  AT
THAT MOMENT something significant happend in my life and I am
writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your
life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!

In mid December, I received this program via e-mail.  Six month's 
prior to receiving this program I had been sending away for 
information on various business opportunities.  All of the programs 
I received, in my opinion, were not cost effective.  They were either 
too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too 
much for me to risk to see if they would work or not.  One claimed 
that I would make a million dollars in one year...it didn't tell me 
I'd have to write a book to make it!  

But like I was saying, in December of 1995 I received this program.  
I didn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a 
mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading 
it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't 
believe my eyes.  Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.
I could invest as much as I wanted to start, without putting me 
further into debt.  After I got a pencil and paper and figured it 
out, I would at least get my money back.  After determining the 
program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided 
"WHY NOT."

Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails.  It cost me about $15.00 for my 
time on-line.  The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any 
money for printing to send out the program, only the cost to fulfill 
my orders.  I am telling you like it is, I hope it doesn't turn you 
off, but I promised myself that I would not "rip-off" anyone, no 
matter how much money it cost me!


In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1.  
By January 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1.  When you read the 
GUARANTEE in the program, you will see that "YOU MUST RECEIVE 15-20
ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS.  IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT
MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!" 
My first step in making $50,000 in 20-90 days was done. By January 30,
I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2.  If you go back to the GUARANTEE, 
"YOU MUST RECEIVE 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS.  
IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.  ONCE YOU HAVE 100 
ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 
GOAL"  Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed.  So I sat 
back and relaxed.  By March 19, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000
with more coming in every day.  

I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.  Please take time 
to read the attatched program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!!  
Remember, it won't work if you don't try it.  This program does work, but you 
must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rules of not trying to place your name 
in a different place.  It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!  
REPORT #2 explains this. Always follow the guarantee, 15-20 orders for 
REPORT #1, and 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 
20-90 days.  I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!

If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry.  It really is a 
great opportunity with little cost or risk to you.  If you choose to participate, 
follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security.  

If you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like I was, or 
you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID!

                               Sincerely,             

                         Christopher Erickson   


P.S. Do you have any idea what 11,700  $5 bills ($58,000) look like 
piled up on a kitchen table?  IT'S AWESOME!


A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:

By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have 
concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have been created 
by an amateur.  

Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business for 10 years.  
Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was doing the same things that were
previously successfull for me, but it wasn't working.  Finally, I figured it out.  
It wasn't me, it was the economy.  Inflation and recession had replaced the stable 
economy that had been with us since 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happend to
the unemployment rate... because many of you know from first hand experience.  
There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. 

The middle class was vanishing.  Those who knew what they were doing invested 
wisely and moved up.  Those who did not, including those who never had anything to
save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of the poor.  As the saying goes, 
"THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER."  The traditional methods
of making money will never allow you to "move up" or "get rich", inflation will 
see to that.

You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest
of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."  
You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined.  

I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money, nor anyone else 
who has provided a testimonial for this program.  I have already made over 
4 MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the program after sending out over 
16,000 programs.  Now I have several offices that make this and several other 
programs here and over seas.  By the spring we wish to market the "internet" by a
partnership with AMERICA ON LINE.  

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Do not change it in any way.  
It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting 
report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 
50,000...and your name will be on everyone of them!  Remember though, the more
you send out the more potential customers you will reach.  

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity 
to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!


"THINK ABOUT IT"
Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little 
time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil and figure out what could 
happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no matter 
how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!  You will definitely get
back what you invested.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders 
come in.  IT WORKS!                    
                                     Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC


HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll 
assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each.  Let's also 
assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response.  Using a good list the response 
could be much better. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of 
programs instead of 2,000.  But continuing with this example, you send out only 
2,000 programs.  With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1.  
Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000.  
Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 mail out 
2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000.  The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 
orders for REPORT #3.  Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 
total.  The 0.5% response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4.  That's 10,000 
$5 bills for you.  CASH!!! Your total income in this example is 
$50 + $500 + $5,000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!!

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE 
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!  
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF 
SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000.  
Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!  By the way, your cost to 
participate in this is practically nothing.  You obviously already have an 
internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!  REPORT #3 will show you the best 
methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
We at Erris Mail Order Marketing Businesses, have a method of raising capital that
REALLY WORKS 100% EVERYTIME.  I am sure that you could use 
$50,000 to $125,000 in the next 20-90 days. Before you say "BULL... ", 
please read this program carefully.  

This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity.  
Basically, this is what you do:  As with all multi-level business, we build our 
business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the 
USA allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer a 
product for EVERY dollar sent.  YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE FILLED
THROUGH THE MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling.  You do it 
privately in your own home, store or office.  
This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: 

Step (1)  Order all four (4) REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER.  
Do this by ordering the REPORT from each of the four (4) names 
listed on the next page.  For each REPORT, send $5 CASH and a 
SELF-ADDRESSED STAMPED envelope (BUSINESS SIZE #10) to the person 
listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT.  International orders should also
include $1 extra for postage.  It is essential that you specify 
the NAME and NUMBER of the REPORT requested to the person you are
ordering it from.  You will need ALL FOUR (4) REPORTS because you 
will be REPRINTING and RESELLING them.  DO NOT alter the names
or sequence other than what the instructions say. 

IMPORTANT: Always provide same-day service on all orders.  

Step (2)  Replace the name and address under REPORT #1 with
your's, moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.  Drop 
the name and address under REPORT #2 TO REPORT #3,  moving 
the one that was there to REPORT #4.  The name and the address 
that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list and this party 
is no doubt on the  way to the bank.  When doing this, make certain
you type the names and addresses ACCURATELY!!!  DO NOT 
MIX UP MOVING PRODUCT/REPORT POSITIONS!!!

Step (3) Having made the requested changes in the NAME list, save
it as text (.txt) file in it's own directory to be used with whatever 
e-mail program you like.  Again, REPORT #3 will tell you the best 
methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists.  

Step (4)  E-mail a copy of the entire program (all of this is very 
important) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on.  
Start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take
advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity.  That's what I 
did.  And they love me now, more than ever.  Then, e-mail to anyone 
and everyone!  Use your imagination!  You can get e-mail addresses 
from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing 
lists.  These are very cheap, 100,000 addresses for around $35.  

IMPORTANT:  You won't get a good response if you use an old
list, so always request a FRESH, NEW list.  You will find out where
to purchase these lists when you order the four (4) REPORTS.  

ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!

REQUIRED REPORTS:
***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***

ALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPE
AND $5 CASH FOR EACH ORDER REQUESTING THE 
SPECIFIC REPORT BY NAME AND NUMBER.

CONCLUSION:
I am enjoying my fortune that I made by sending out this program.  
You too, will be making money in 20-90 days, if you follow the
SIMPLE STEPS outlined in this mailing.

To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make financial 
decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into investments, 
retire or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of money hold you 
back.

However, very few people reach financial independence, because
when opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is much 
easier to say "NO" than "YES", and this the question that you must 
answer.  Will YOU ignore this amazing opportunity or will you 
take advantage of it?  If you do nothing, you have indeed missed 
something and nothing will change.  Please re-read this material, 
this is a special opportunity.  If you have any questions, please 
feel free to write to the sender of this information.  You will get
a prompt and informative reply.

My method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5 
that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail.  I should also point out 
that this program is LEGAL and everyone who participates WILL
make money.  This is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam.  At times 
you probably received chain letters, asking you to send money, on 
faith, but getting NOTHING in return, NO product what-so-ever!  
Not only are chain lettters illegal, but the risk of someone breaking 
the chain  makes them quite unattractive.

You are offering a legitimate product to your people.  After they 
purchase the product from you, they reproduce more and resell them.  
It's simple free enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed 
material, the PRODUCT is a series of four (4) FINANCIAL AND
BUSINESS REPORTS.  The information contained in these
REPORTS will not only help you in making your participation in 
this program more rewarding, but will be useful to you in any other 
business decisions you make in the years ahead.  You are also 
buying the rights to reprint all of the REPORTS, which will be 
ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program.  The 
concise one and two page REPORTS you will be buying can easily 
be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a
copy.  Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!
