We did a mailing of 1 1/2 million emails for one of our customers. He 
was selling a home workers manual for $29.95. His results are very 
typical and scary. He took in over 700 orders! 700 x $29.95 = $20,000. 
This gentleman was so amazed, that after being skeptical, it had 
really happened to him, he made it, he found a niche. That niche 
was email! He went on to buy our full list and will be set for life in less 
than six months time. All this from selling a simple manual via e.mail.

That was just one of the many success stories we hear everyday.
