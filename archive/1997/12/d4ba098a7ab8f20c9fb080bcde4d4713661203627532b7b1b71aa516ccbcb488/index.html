This entire issue speaks to whether we neeed government or not.  The power
of the judiciary is part and parcel of the power of Government, and in many
cases -this is an excellent example- is all that stands between The
Oligarchy and Freedom.

Imagine if there _were_ no government per-se, and it was the Disney, or
Westinghouse, or GE, or whoever the fuck, corporate security forces taking
action on their own against FRB.

&gt;  
&gt;   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;                 COURT REJECTS FCC'S CONSTITUTIONAL CATCH 22
&gt;                                       
&gt;     United States District Court Judge Claudia Wilken has rejected
&gt;     another attempt by the Federal Communications Commission to silence
&gt;     Berkeley Micro Radio Broadcaster Stephen Dunifer, founder of Free
&gt;     Radio Berkeley.
&gt;     
&gt;     In a 13 page opinion released on November 12, 1997, Judge Wilken
&gt;     once again rejected the government's motion for an injunction to
&gt;     silence micro radio broadcasts by local radio pioneer Stephen
&gt;     Dunifer.
&gt;     
&gt;     In 1995, Judge Wilken rejected the government's first motion for a
&gt;     preliminary injunction against Dunifer's broadcasts. At that time
&gt;     the Court found merit in Dunifer's argument that the FCC's ban on
&gt;     low power, affordable FM broadcasting was a violation of the First
&gt;     Amendment's guarantee of free speech to all in the United States.
&gt;     
&gt;     In a blatant attempt to avoid facing its First Amendment obligations
&gt;     the FCC then urged Wilken to permanently enjoin Dunifer from
&gt;     Broadcasting and at the same time argued that she could not even
&gt;     consider the issue of whether its rules, which prevent him from
&gt;     getting a license, are unconstitutional. In a Kafkaesqe argument,
&gt;     the Commission argued that Wilken had jurisdiction to issue an
&gt;     injunction, but no jurisdiction to hear Dunifer's constitutional
&gt;     arguments. The government claimed that only the higher federal
&gt;     courts could consider the constitutional question.
&gt;     
&gt;     In her November 12 decision rejecting the Government's position,
&gt;     Judge Wilken pointed to the fact that the FCC had taken exactly the
&gt;     opposite position in the 1994 case of Dougan vs FCC. In that case,
&gt;     an Arizona micro radio broadcaster had appealed an FCC fine (for
&gt;     broadcasting without a license) to the 9th Circuit Federal Court of
&gt;     Appeal, and the FCC had argued that the Court of Appeal had no
&gt;     jurisdiction over the case, and that it had to be heard by the
&gt;     District Court. The Court of Appeals agreed with the FCC and sent
&gt;     the case back to the District Court.
&gt;     
&gt;     Judge Wilken noted that the Arizona broadcaster had raised the same
&gt;     constitutional arguments in the Court of Appeals that Dunifer is
&gt;     raising. The Court ruled that in sending all of the issues in the
&gt;     Arizona case to the District Court, the Appeals Court recognized
&gt;     that the District Court had jurisdiction over all aspects of the
&gt;     case.
&gt;     
&gt;     In denying the Government's motion for an injunction "without
&gt;     prejudice," Judge Wilken ordered the Government to file a further
&gt;     brief on the question of whether the unconstitutionality of the
&gt;     FCC's ban on micro radio is a valid legal defense to an injunction
&gt;     against broadcasting at low power without a license. Dunifer's
&gt;     attorneys, Louis Hiken and Allen Hopper of San Francisco, will have
&gt;     an opportunity to rebut the government's arguments on this point.
&gt;     
&gt;     In response to pressure from the commercial broadcaster's lobby, the
&gt;     National Association of Broadcasters (N.A.B.), the FCC has in recent
&gt;     months been stepping up its campaign of harassment against the
&gt;     thousands of micro radio stations now on the air in this country.
&gt;     Hiken commented "The broadcast industry is clearly afraid of these
&gt;     little community stations which are speaking truth to its power. In
&gt;     trying to do the N.A.B.'s bidding, the FCC demonstrates that it is
&gt;     nothing but an enforcement arm of the commercial broadcast industry
&gt;     and the multi-national corporations which own it."
&gt;     
&gt;     The National Lawyers Guild's Committee on Democratic Communications
&gt;     has represented the Lawyers Guild, San Francisco's Media Alliance,
&gt;     and the Women's International News Gathering Services as a "Friend
&gt;     of the Court" (Amicus) in this case. In its Friend of the Court
&gt;     brief the Lawyers Guild pointed out that FCC regulations make it
&gt;     impossible for all but the very wealthy to even apply for a
&gt;     broadcast license. This, they told the Court, is the equivalent of
&gt;     saying anyone could speak from a soap box in the park, but the box
&gt;     had to be made of gold. Guild attorney Peter Franck commented "In an
&gt;     era when Disney owns ABC, the world's largest defense contractor
&gt;     owns NBC and CNN merges with Time which merges with Warner, and when
&gt;     'public' broadcasting is told to get its money from corporations,
&gt;     micro radio may be our last best hope for democracy on the air
&gt;     ways." He continued "Judge Wilken's decision is a courageous
&gt;     rejection of the Government's attempt to use a legal Catch-22 to
&gt;     avoid facing the fact that its ban on micro radio flies in the face
&gt;     of the Constitution."
&gt;     
&gt;     The legal team representing Dunifer and the Amicae are very pleased
&gt;     with Judge Wilken's reasoned and thorough decision denying the FCC's
&gt;     motion to have the case resolved without a trial on the merits. For
&gt;     almost 70 years, the FCC has catered solely to the interests of
&gt;     commercial corporate giants, through their mouthpiece, the National
&gt;     Association of Broadcasters. These are the pirates, who have stolen
&gt;     the airwaves from the American people, and who represent corporate
&gt;     interests valued at more than 60 billion dollars. Only the Pentagon,
&gt;     the Silicon Valley and the transportation industries possess the
&gt;     financial wallop represented by the NAB and its constituents.
&gt;     
&gt;     Judge Wilken's decision represents a vision of what it would be like
&gt;     for the American people to be given back their own voice. The
&gt;     decision suggests the likely unconstitutionality of the entire
&gt;     regulatory structure underlying the FCC's ban on low power radio. It
&gt;     forewarns of the total failure of that agency to carry out its
&gt;     statutory obligation to regulate the airwaves in the public interest
&gt;     -- that is, in the interest of the American people, rather than the
&gt;     media monopolies that control our airwaves.
&gt;     
&gt;     The legal team welcomes the opportunity to have a court identify the
&gt;     real pirates of the airwaves -- not the thousands of microradio
&gt;     broadcasters who seek to communicate with the people of their
&gt;     communities, but rather the billionaire commercial interests that
&gt;     control the airwaves as if they own them. Is it General Electric,
&gt;     Westinghouse and the Disney Corporation that have the right to
&gt;     control local community radio, or is that a right that belongs to
&gt;     all of the American people, regardless of economic status?
