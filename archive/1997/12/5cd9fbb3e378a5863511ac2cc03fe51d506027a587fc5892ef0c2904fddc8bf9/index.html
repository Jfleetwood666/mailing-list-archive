Here is the piece about the CNN show transposed to another,
accurately analagous context to show the utter idiocy of what's
going on. What's really sad, what's really scary, is how _little_ I
actually had to transpose to do this. All I changed were the 
occurrences of "online," "software," and "Surf."  I modified a 
couple of other related words just to comport with the shift of 
the metaphor from online to streets/public places.  Many paragraphs 
remain unaltered because they contain none of the key words.

For credible transposition, imagine that the "tools" they're
discussing are something like a headset, blinders, and body armor
that kids can be made to wear while in public to protect them from
the realities of public places. Ask yourself how different that
would be from the assinine blocking software being discussed in the
original interview, and how intelligent is it to presume to think
one can mold all public places to be as safe and comfy as the family
living room. These people must be on very strong drugs.

This is also an indirect statement on the utter superficiality of 
present day "news" coverage. The original interview _says_ virtually 
nothing, communicates virtually no facts. It is really just an 
emotional rallying and back-patting with little discernable 
in the way of contextual detail.

&gt; HEADLINE:  Kids &amp; Public Streets

&gt;     JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNNfn ANCHOR, ASPHALT JAM: Next week family
&gt; advocates, educators and industry leaders are coming together to
&gt; discuss ways to keep children safe on public streets.  One of the
&gt; sponsors of the Streets Summit is Curbwatch, a company that makes
&gt; blocking tools to help parents and teachers filter out
&gt; objectionable street content.

&gt;     Joining me now from Stanford, California to discuss the goals
&gt; of the summit is Michael Sears.  He is the president of Curbwatch. 
&gt; Michael it's great to have you on ASPHALT JAM.  Welcome to you.

&gt;     MICHAEL SEARS, PRESIDENT, CURBWATCH: Thank you, a pleasure to
&gt; be here.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: First of all, let's discuss how this summit came
&gt; about.  Was it a building movement that finally crescendo.

&gt;     SEARS: I think it is.  It's actually the outgrowth of what we
&gt; did last June with President Clinton and Vice President Gore.  In
&gt; fact June and July time frame the SDA (Streets Decency Act) was
&gt; overturned.  The White House decided to take the initiative and
&gt; asked the industry to get together to see what we can do to
&gt; actually empower kids and enable kids on the streets.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS OK.  What is the happy medium here, Michael because
&gt; that's what everybody is really looking for because the Street
&gt; Decency Act did stumble and we had people on both side of the
&gt; debate wanting to stake out their territory.  What is , in your
&gt; view, is the center ground?

&gt;     SEARS: Well, the debate will continue, but the center ground
&gt; really is that it's all about kids.  What we're talking about doing
&gt; here is bringing together industry and law enforcement and public
&gt; policy people and talking about to empower kids on streets and give
&gt; them effective tools. Effective tools that are also very easy to
&gt; use.

&gt;     The idea behind that is how can kids actually get onto the
&gt; streets, learn, research, discover, play and do it in a really
&gt; enriching environment. But also we realize that there are a lot of
&gt; safety concerns in public places. That's probably what we're going
&gt; to talk about primarily.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: How about the ACLU, they were raising concerns
&gt; about being blocked out here or filtration or censorship on the
&gt; extreme.  How do you deal with that side of - the people on that
&gt; side of the debate?

&gt;     SEARS: It's a slippery slope.  The idea here is do we block,
&gt; companies like Curbwatch, do we block content in public places.
&gt; The idea once again is we target your typical 12 year old in the
&gt; US.  If that 12 year old should see something or if that 12 years
&gt; old needs to discover something we try to make sure that we have
&gt; all of our technology, all of our processes in place to insure that
&gt; information comes forward.  Such as, we don't block the idea of
&gt; breast, for instance, because breast could be talking about a
&gt; chicken recipe.  It could be talk about breast cancer.  However, if
&gt; it's a sexually explicit depiction or expression of that word
&gt; that's where you come in and use filtering tools to block.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: There's another side to this, of course, that kids
&gt; are often much more street savvy than their parents.  How do you
&gt; over that hurdle?

&gt;     SEARS: That's a major hurdle.  In fact we're talking about
&gt; empowering kids with effective tools, but those tools have to be
&gt; very easy to use and the ease of use isn't really for the kids
&gt; because the kids know how to do this stuff. They know what's on the
&gt; streets. They know what's out there and they know how to get
&gt; there. What we really provide are the easy to use tools for mom
&gt; and dad. So mom and dad pointing and clicking and turning switches
&gt; on and off very easily can really control the family's environment.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: As you know, this is a political hot potato for
&gt; President Clinton because he didn't want to seem extreme on both
&gt; side and he would like industry to work it out.  When it is all
&gt; said and done, Michael, what is the solution here?

&gt;     SEARS: Well, the solution that this market is all about is
&gt; called parental control.  Curbwatch started the market about three
&gt; years ago and the word parental control itself was important not
&gt; only because it's the technology, but because of those first two
&gt; words, parental control.  Mom and dad have to be involved.  Mom and
&gt; dad have to engage not only to help the kids in public places, but
&gt; also make sure that in street conversations or with graffiti or
&gt; with explicit pictures they can really sit down and talk to the
&gt; kids and moderate what their kids are doing.  We're just a tool.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: This is not a government.  Not to interrupt you,
&gt; but we're almost out of time here.  But this is, you're saying, not
&gt; government intervention then.

&gt;     SEARS: Absolutely.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: The technology is out there to let the families
&gt; tackle this on their own.

&gt;     SEARS: That on and off switch should be in the hands of moms
&gt; and dads not the government.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: OK, great.  How about your market share before we
&gt; let you go tonight?  How are you faring against your competition?

&gt;     SEARS: I think we're doing very well.  All the buzz that's
&gt; been happening over the last couple of months has helped our shares
&gt; as well as our competitors. We've shipped millions of copies, 7.2
&gt; last July. We haven't done the survey lately, but we're clearly in
&gt; the tens of millions right now.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: OK.  It's great to have you.

&gt;     SEARS: Great to be here.  Thanks very much.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: And have a nice Thanksgiving holiday.

&gt;     SEARS: Same to you.  Take care.

&gt;     DEFTERIOS: My pleasure.  Michael Sears, president of Curbwatch,
&gt; joining us from Stanford, California.
