Dear Mr. Morris,

Thank you for submitting your unsolicited resume for our consideration.

Our company, Algebra Consulting Services International, does not need 
people with only Windows experience.

We think that exposure to Windows tends to prevent people from properly
developing their brains, and see it as a minus rather than a plus.

The personnel of Algebra Consulting is known for their in-depth
experience with Unix programming and Object-Oriented systems design in
languages like C++, Eiffel and Perl, and has enjoyed substantial revenue
growth in the last decade.

I wish you luck in your endeavours and hope that you can find a Windows
job elsewhere.

Best regards,

	- Igor Chudov, Personnel Director, Algebra Consulting Services Inc.

&gt; Experiences to Note
&gt; 
&gt; I have recently returned from London, England. The cultural, artistic,

&gt; immeasurable.  Having socialized and developed friendships with individuals
&gt; from around the world including Italy, South Africa, Spain, Canada, USA,
&gt; Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ireland, and more has given me a tremendous
&gt; insight into global business operations and methods. Having worked closely as
&gt; a top level manager for a UK Charity, and also as a foreman on construction
&gt; for the Australian Embassy in the UK, I have observed many unique and
&gt; insightful ideas which I now intend to share.
&gt; 
&gt; For two years I have worked closely with a business partner to establish a
&gt; small business. In doing so, I have learned the value of hard work. I have
&gt; proven my ability to work 12 to 16 hours every day, for months. I have
&gt; learned, in detail, exact laws, regulation, and policy of business operations
&gt; in over five industries. I have gained magnificent insight into the needs of
&gt; a corporation, and what that corporation must expect from its employees.
&gt; Although there are thousands more considerations I can list as to the
&gt; benefits of this training, I will simply close with a quotation:            
&gt; 
&gt;                Ability is nothing without opportunity - Napoleon.
