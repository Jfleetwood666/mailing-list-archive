JOIN REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA) LIVE ONLINE TUESDAY JUNE 3, 8:30 PM ET

Who is Congressman Bob Goodlatte?  Depending on your point of view, the
Republican Congressman from Virginia is either a steadfast champion of
online privacy, or a supporter of censorship in cyberspace.

This year, Rep. Goodlatte has been leading a successful charge to
overturn the Clinton administration's encryption control policies.
Goodlatte is the principal author of H.R. 695, "The Security and Freedom
through Encryption (SAFE) Act." -- a bill designed to promote privacy
and security on the Internet by encouraging the widespread availability
of encryption technology.  Goodlatte's efforts to protect privacy and
prohibit the government from imposing "key-escrow" and
"key-recovery" domestically have won him praise from Internet users.

The SAFE bill was recently approved by the House Judiciary Committee
(the first time an encryption reform bill has ever cleared a major
Congressional committee), and is now headed to the House International
Relations Committee where a tougher fight is expected.

But in 1995, Rep. Goodlatte was a leading supporter of the
Communications Decency Act (CDA) -- a law which for the first time
imposed broad content regulations on the Internet.  The CDA is currently
being reviewed by the Supreme Court and a decision is expected before
the end of June.

Join Congressman Goodlatte for a live, Virtual Town Hall meeting and
find out what makes him tick.

You can submit questions in advance by visiting
http://www.democracy.net. The discussion will be moderated by Todd
Lappin, Section Editor at Wired Magazine.

BACKGROUND ON REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA)

[This information is taken verbatim from Rep. Goodlatte's World Wide Web

Bob Goodlatte, age 44, was elected to serve as the Sixth District's
Congressman in November of 1992. He was re-elected to his second term
without opposition in 1994.

He is a graduate of Washington and Lee University School of Law, and
his undergraduate degree in Government was earned at Bates College in
Lewiston, Maine.

Before being elected to Congress, Bob served as former Congressman
Caldwell Butler's District Office Manager from 1977 to 1979, where he
was responsible for helping folks across the Sixth District. In 1979,
he founded his own private law practice in Roanoke. He is a former
partner in the law firm of Bird, Kinder and Huffman, working there from
1981 until taking office.

Bob has long been active in his community, serving as President of the
Civitan Club of Roanoke, and he's been active with the Parent Teachers
Association at his children's public school and with the United Way of
the Roanoke Valley.

Bob serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Agriculture Committee.
His subcommittee assignments on Judiciary are: the Constitution
Subcommittee and the Courts &amp; Intellectual Property Subcommittee. His
subcommittee assignments on Agriculture are: the Livestock Subcommittee
and the Department Operations and Nutrition Program Subcommittee where
he serves as the Chairman.

After Republicans won the majority, Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) selected
Bob to serve as an Assistant Whip.
