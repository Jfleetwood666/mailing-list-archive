Do you know how to use email? Then you should be making money hand over fist on the Internet!  By the time you're finished reading this letter, you'll know EXACTLY how I'm doing it, and how YOU can too!

Here we go...

Introducing "The NEW Complete Internet Business Starter Kit!!!"

If you can spare just 5 minutes of your time, I promise to deliver an opportunity unlike anything you've ever seen!

     You CAN start a very profitable business on the
     Internet WITHOUT spending a lot of money!

How would you like to start a spare time business with YOUR OWN kit of cutting edge information products? What if everything in the kit came with unlimited and unrestricted ownership rights? You could sell this much sought after information for whatever price you wanted!  And get this... You could even offer those rights along with your products! You'll be helping others start their own business!

    Would you be interested in an opportunity like this?
    How about if all the work has been taken out of it?

As you know, there are many "business opportunities" floating around on the Internet. Some great, some not so great. But how can you tell the REAL opportunities from the money pits?  YOU CAN'T! All you can do is choose a path and hope it's not a dead end.  If you CAN find the right opportunity, you can make a bundle of money in a very short time. Here's why...

The "Internet population explosion" is now under way. The actual numbers are a little hard to fathom, but here they are...  In 1996 alone, over A MILLION people per MONTH have been signing up with an internet access provider! That's over 12 MILLION people per year! Even if this rate remains the same, and many expect it to increase, there will be more than 100 MILLION people online by the year 2000!

So what does this mean to you? Simple. Like you, many of these 12 million newcomers per year will be looking for legitimate business opportunities. They'll also be looking for specialized information that will teach them how to start and operate their own high income, online business.  The fact is, there are simply just not enough sources to meet these overwhelming demands!

           That's where you come in!

You can meet BOTH of these demands with this NEW Complete Internet Business Starter Kit!

Now, in a minute I'm going to tell you exactly what this information kit consists of. But before I do, I want to explain how it's a little different from ALL the others...

Everything in this kit comes with UNLIMITED AND UNRESTRICTED REPRODUCTION RIGHTS!

O.K. So you've seen reprint/reproduction rights being sold before.

*** BUT NOT LIKE THIS!! ***

"UNRESTRICTED" means just that! Not only can you sell this kit as YOUR VERY OWN, you can sell ALL rights along with it!  That's what makes this kit sell with very little effort!  Check around! You'll never find another company that lets you do this!  (Actually, I've taken a little heat from some of my fellow information brokers over this decision. They insist I'll create my own competition. But when I explain the raw numbers of people jumping online every month, they seem to quiet down very quickly!)

All right, here's what this exciting new information kit consists of...

1. "The Information Freeway!"   It covers everything from rules and regulations, to how to use the newest online marketing strategies, including direct email! 

You'll learn everything you need to know about this brand new world of opportunity!

2. 300 new reports designed to help upstart entrepreneurs!  These aren't the typical out of date reports that circulate till the end of time. Originally published in 1996, these reports contain real info you can use! Check these out...

How To Protect Your PC From Email Viruses, How To Get Over 300 Prospects To Email You Weekly, Insiders Secrets On Advertising With The Major Online Services, What's Wrong with The World Wide Web, and Taxes For The Home Based Business Owner, and many, many more!

3.  A free copy of the latest version of Pegasus, the most advanced e-mail software ever, and by far the easiest to use.  With Pegasus you can send out 500, 1,000, even 50,000 sales letters every single day.

4.  A working demo copy of Email Pro, the brand new $500 software used by all the major online marketers.  With Email Pro you can extract thousands of targeted e-mail addresses per hour from the major online services.

5.  100,000 freshly extracted e-mail addresses of opportunity seekers and multi-level enthusiasts.  All of these addresses are from the major online services and the Internet.  America On Line, Prodigy, CompuServe, Microsoft Network, Genie and Delphi.  These are people who enjoy reading about new opportunities and they are Buyers.

6. And get a load of this!! To make this a Complete Internet Business Starter Kit, you'll get your own customized version of this same sales letter. You can use any or the entire letter as your very own! All the "work" has been done for you! It just doesn't get any easier than this!

        O.K. Let's get down to the nitty gritty! 

I'm sure you're thinking, "O.K. Sounds good, but how much is this gonna set me back financially"? You've seen what everyone else is charging for information that's not nearly as comprehensive as this..$200? $100? $59.95?

            Well, Prepare To Be Shocked!

The entire NEW Complete Internet Business Starter Kit is only $39.95... plus $5.50 Shipping &amp; Handling

Sound too good to be true? That's what others have said.  That is, until they received their kit and saw for themselves just how easy it is to make money on the net!

Here's a little more incentive to check this out...
      
        2 FREE BONUSES FOR EVERYONE WHO ORDERS WITHIN 7 DAYS!!!

1. The List! Did you know there are over 1,000 FREE and ALMOST FREE advertising sites?  I'll include a listing of the addresses. (There's a section in the manual that teaches you exactly how to post ads at these sites.)

2.   An EXTRA 100,000 fresh e-mail addresses of opportunity seekers and multi-level enthusiasts.  That will give you 200,000 eager buyers to mail this and any other offer you may have.  This list has been known to pull as much as a 15% response rate.  Can you imagine how much money you'll make with even a 2 or 3 per cent response?

Well, that's about it. As you can see, this is truly a Complete Internet Business Starter Kit! Right down to your own deal closing sales letter! You're already paying to be online, why not make some money? Even if you sell ONLY ONE KIT, you've broken even! Everything after that is pure profit!

Now that you know what you stand to gain, let's consider what you have to spend. Just $39.95!  This is a small cost for the collection of reports and information that can have you in business, the day you receive your information package.

Remember, not only will you be learning the most up to date information about making money online, you'll be teaching others how to succeed! (And making money in the process!)

########################  NEW ADDITIONAL OFFER  ##################

Question: Remember when you first considered going on line?  You had dozens of questions and didn't know where to go for the answers.  

Many of us that had these questions started reading newspaper and magazine articles to familiarize ourselves with this new media!  We also started reading "classified ads" to see what others are doing on-line!

GUESS WHAT?   MILLIONS ARE DOING THE SAME, TODAY!

With the rapid expansion of the Internet, the information in the $39.95 Business Kit is a necessity, today.  But many CUSTOMERS that I've spoken with have a desire to market this package in the 'Print Media', as I do (magazines &amp; newspapers, etc.)

The Business Kit gets you "Safely" up and running on the Internet, but what about those who are just coming on line.  Or those just considering if it's PROFITABLE to go on line with their business?? This segment of the population is still reading Newspapers and Magazines to see what they can learn about the subject before 'jumping-in'.  

Being involved in Multi-Level-Marketing and Mail-order businesses have taught me a great deal through the years. I've made plenty of mistakes along the way.

              ***************YOU DON'T HAVE TO!!!!**************

I've developed an additional package of information to compliment the
Internet Business Starter Kit.  I call this the 'PLUS' package.  How can this help you?

1. Do you know the best newspapers to advertise in?  

(I'll supply a listing of hundreds of newspapers and their phone numbers!)

2. Do you know where to get an 800 number with voice mail for advertising at the very lowest possible price?  (Including too many benefits to list)  (I'm constantly updating information to provide the best possible programs and pricing!)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
SPECIAL OFFER............................IF YOU ORDER WITHIN 7 DAYS !!!

I'LL SEND THE 'STARTER KIT', PLUS THE ADDITIONAL PACKAGE FOR THE TOTAL PRICE OF $34.95 and I'll pay the shipping &amp; handling myself.  That will save you an additional $10.50!
