New Cryptanalysis Course Announced by NTI One Day
Course for Corporate, Military and Law Enforcement Computer
Specialists 

Covers Issues in Cryptography and Cryptanalysis

Gresham, Ore., May 20 -- NTI today announced a one day class which 
gives corporate, military and law enforcement MIS personnel a
state-of-the-art grounding on the topics of computer
cryptography and cryptanalysis. With materials developed by
Eric Thompson, one of the world leading experts in this field,
attendees will receive instruction in the technological and
procedural elements of cryptanalysis. Unlike other sources of
information on the topic, this presentation covers the analysis
of existing commercial applications and their weaknesses. 

This course joins NTI's other courses in forensic computer
science. The forensic courses covers state-of-the-art
information regarding computer evidence processing,
evidence preservation and the identification of relevant data. 

"This class in cryptography grew out of requests for more
information on encryption from our forensics course
attendees. The course is highly focused and is presented with
state-of-the-art materials," stated Michael R. Anderson, the
President and co-founder of NTI, "and it covers material that
has historically not been presented from a practical
perspective. Computer and data security are rapidly becoming
a top priority as organizations become increasingly aware of
their vulnerability to information attack and encryption is a
vital part of reducing that vulnerability." 

Topics covered in the NTI cryptography course include: 

  Cryptographic terms and lexicon 

  Basics of crypto system design 

  Isolating cryptographic weakness in commercial systems 

  Cryptography in electronic commerce 

  Cryptography in Internet security applications 

  International issues in cryptography and secure applications 

  The Future of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis 

"Eric Thompson, our senior cryptographer, developed the
materials used in the presentation of this unique course,"
continued Anderson. "Eric is a world class cryptographer,
highly respected in both commercial and government
cryptography circles. In this class he brings to the topic at
hand real world, practical experience that has helped a
majority of government agencies deal with encryption issues."

Courses are regularly scheduled for presentation at the NTI
headquarters in Gresham, Oregon, and at conference facilities
throughout the United States; custom courses can also be
scheduled for presentation at corporate or government sites.
Attendance is $995 per person and includes all course
materials, luncheon and a certificate of completion. 

NTI (New Technologies, Inc.) is a world leading developer
of software utilities, procedures and training for computer
forensics and enterprise system security. Founded in 1996 by
a group of internationally recognized experts on computer
forensics and security issues, the company is privately held
with headquarters in Gresham, Oregon and field offices in
Eugene, Oregon; Provo, Utah, and Atlanta, Georgia.

Forensic and Encryption Training

3 Day Oregon Training Schedule: May 20-22, June 24-26, 
July 22-24, Aug 19-21, Sept 16-18, Oct 21-23

Law enforcement and military agencies have been involved 
in processing computer evidence for years. The founders of NTI 
were instrumental in the creation of the training courses in the 
field of Forensic Computer Science that have become the 
international standard for evidence processing world wide. 

They developed the first computer evidence courses at the Federal 
Law Enforcement Training Center and created the original training 
courses and certification for the International Association of 
Computer Investigative Specialists. These founders have also been
instrumental in developing password recovery software which deals 
with the breaking of security associated with a majority of the 
commercial word processing, spread sheet and database software 
applications. 

In addition, a majority of the computer evidence processing tools 
used by law enforcement and military agencies were developed by the 
founders or employees of NTI.

With the creation of NTI, corporations and government agencies 
now have access to forensic information and tools which can be 
used in the identification of computer security risks and in
internal investigations. NTI will also continue to support law 
enforcement and military agencies by making state-of-the art 
training and automated forensic tools available at discounted rates. 

For security reasons, our training courses and forensic software 
tools are only made available to law enforcement agencies, 
government agencies, large corporations and consultants who
work with large corporations and/or government agencies.

Applied Cryptography &amp; Cryptanalysis

NTI has three full time cryptographers employed in its Utah offices. 
Our file encryption software is developed in that facility and Eric 
Thompson is our senior cryptographer. Eric's credentials are
mentioned elsewhere in our web site. However, it is safe to say that 
he is one of the top cryptographers in the world and has broken the 
security associated with most commercial applications that feature 
encryption or password protection. We rely upon Eric and his team to
teach these courses at the sites of sponsoring government agencies 
and corporations.
