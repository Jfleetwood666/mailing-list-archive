Bob, I just announced this today for our public company. It might
 be appropriate to send it to either or both of your e$lab and FC98
 mailing lists.  I am not going to be able to accommodate hundreds
 of ventures but, given that some will have their own resources,
 money, etc. and only want the venue and the Bank to play with...
 it may be very interesting for all of us.  Add this to the pot
 in whatever way you feel is appropriate.

 Cheers,
 Lyn

 PRESS RELEASE                                FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 Hansa.net and Hansa Bank  join forces to encourage the development of
     e-commerce financial products and services to further expand
 Hansa.net's offerings of Location Optimized Commerce on the Internet
                               (LOCI ).

 October 1, 1997 - Hansa.net Global Commerce, Inc. together with Hansa
 Bank  &amp; Trust Company Limited, both of Anguilla, British West Indies,
 and  both  members of the Span-Hansa Group, have agreed  to   jointly
 sponsor  emerging Internet technologies which will enhance e-commerce
 through specifically tailored banking and financial applications.

 Lynwood  S. Bell, Chairman of Hansa Bank, the controlling shareholder
 of Hansa.net a publicly traded company, said "Many excellent start-up
 companies  lack a vehicle through which to perfect their  product  or
 service  and  to  test  their  market acceptance.   Most  traditional
 domestic banks, encumbered with vast legacy systems and bureaucracies
 are reluctant to entertain these developers in live trials. The Hansa
 Bank,  a  British  regulated  private merchant  and  investment  bank
 offering  a full range of banking and brokerage services, has  agreed
 to  provide  platforms  for approved developers  and  to  participate
 actively  with  them.  All applications will be thoroughly  screened,
 carefully controlled in their development and testing phases and will
 be  completely isolated from the Bank's existing business.  The  Bank
 expects  that some of these products may eventually result in leading
 edge products and services for the Bank."

 Hansa.net's  role  will  be  to assist  in  marketing  any  developed
 products  to  other  banks  and  financial  institutions.   As   well
 Hansa.net's  existing LOCI clients are expected to benefit  from  the
 Bank's new or enhanced services.

 The  first project, currently undergoing final review prior to  being
 accepted  by  the  Bank for testing, involves a  Dutch  developer  of
 digital  chequing.   Plans  are to demonstrate  the  product  at  the
 Financial  Cryptograph  98  Conference,  February  23-26,  1998  (see
 http:www.fc98.ai).   Hansa  Bank is  one  of  the  sponsors  of  this
 conference.

 Vince Cate, an Internet and cryptography expert recently featured  in
 Forbes and Wired Magazines is participating with Hansa.net and  Hansa
 Bank on this project. He said,  "Many brilliant e-commerce ideas  and
 products never reach the market because they have no incubator or  no
 real  life  environment in which to test.  Hansa.net and  Hansa  Bank
 provide  both.   As  well,  Anguilla is the perfect  venue  for  such
 development  in terms of sample size, global perspective,  government
 support,  and  of course, the absence of any taxes.  We fully  expect
 that  many  of the products developed will end up in companies  which
 are incorporated and reside here in Anguilla."

 About Hansa.net and the related Span-Hansa Group

 Hansa.net  was  founded in 1978 for computer systems development  and
 software  design.  In 1985 the company went public, and  subsequently
 expanded   into   software   product  development,   marketing,   and
 international  trade  technology.  Hansa.net's  primary  role  is  to
 coordinate all of the elements of Location Optimized Commerce on  the
 Internet  (LOCI  pronounced  "low-see") for  its  clients.  Hansa.net
 trades on the Vancouver Stock Exchange under the symbol "HAN"

 Both  companies  are part of the Span-Hansa Group  comprised  of  ten
 organizations doing business in as many international locations.  The
 Group's   activities  also  include  the  financing  of  intellectual
 property,  public  stock  offerings, acquisitions  and  mergers,  and
 consulting on international business structures and trade.  The Group
 maintains offices in Amsterdam, Barbados, and Anguilla,
