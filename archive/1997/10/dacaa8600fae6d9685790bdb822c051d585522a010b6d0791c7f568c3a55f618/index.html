MONEY BACK GUARANTEED GREEN CARDS (MBG PROGRAM)
Are you looking for an Immigration Lawyer that can guarantee you a Green Card? Would you be willing to pay the cost of guaranteeing a Green Card? While nobody can actually guarantee you a  Green Card, the MBG Program gives you the next best alternative. The MBG Program, developed and offered by the American Immigration Information Center, guarantees your money back if your Green Card Application  is not approved within a specified period of time. That means if you apply for a Green Card through the MBG program, you pay nothing unless you get the Green Card. The Center assumes the financial risk of your effort to get the Green Card. Of course you pay for that risk when you end up receiving the Green Card. Because of the high risk involved the MBG program is relatively expensive. But you have nothing to lose through this program. You get a Green Card or you spend nothing. The MBG-1 program, for example, guarantees you an approved petition within One Year or all your money back!
 . Other MBG categories include MBG
-2, MBG-3, MBG-5, MBG-7, MBG-10 and MBG-15. The cost range from $995 to $9,995 depending on the MBG category. To receive Free Information about the MBG program, contact the American Immigration Information Center. Email: usvisa@aol.com greencard1@consular.com   
 Tel: 202-429-5523 Address:  1825 Eye Street, NW Suite 400, Washington, DC 20006. USA.
