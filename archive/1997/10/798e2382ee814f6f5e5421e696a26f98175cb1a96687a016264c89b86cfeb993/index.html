                         *** MAKE $34,000 in 14 WEEKS ***
              
The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a huge amount
of money in a short time.  

   I was approached several times before I checked this out.  I joined just 
   to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money 
   required.  Initially I let no one in the organization know that I was an    attorney and, to my astonishment, I received $34,470.00 in the first        14 weeks, with money still coming in.

                      Sincerely yours, Biron Stary, Esquire

businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners
and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit
new multi- level business online (with your computer).

The product in this program is a series of four reports. Each order 
will include the e-mail address of the sender.  To fill each order, 
you simply e-mail the product to the buyer. No postage or time wasted.  
THAT'S IT!...the $5.00 is yours!

This is what you MUST do:

1.  Order the reports listed and numbered from the list below.
    For each report send $5.00 CASH, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and YOUR
    RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to each person listed.

     When you order, make sure you request each SPECIFIC report.  You
     will need all three reports, because you will be saving them on your 
     computer and reselling them.

2.  IMPORTANT--DO NOT alter the names, or their sequence other than
    instructed in this program! Or you will not profit the way you should.

    Replace the name and address under REPORT #1 with yours, moving
    the one that was there down to REPORT #2.  Move the name and
    address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3. Bump off the name in
    the 3rd position, they already are have made thousands, 
    it's your turn now!   

    When doing this, please make certain you copy everyone's name and
    address ACCURATELY!!!  Also, DO NOT move the Report/Product
    positions!

3.  Take this entire program text, including the corrected names list,
    and save it on your computer.

4.  Now you're ready to start a massive advertising campaign on the
    WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,
    but there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise also.  Another
    avenue which you could use is e-mail mailing lists.  You can buy
    these lists for under $20/1,000 addresses.  START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN
    AS SOON AS YOU CAN. You should pass this opportunity on to all
    you friends, family, business partners, everyone! The more people that
    participate, the more CASH you make!!!

      ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!
 
                      ********REQUIRED REPORTS********

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$

Let's say you decide to start small just to see how it goes.  Assume
your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level.
(Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet could EASILY get a better
response.)  Also assume that everyone else in YOUR BUILDING 
ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 members.  Follow this example 
for the STAGGERING results below.

1st level -- your 10 members with $5   ($5 x 10)                $50
2nd level -- 10 members from those 10  ($5 x 100)              $500
3rd level -- 10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)          $5,000

         			
                                      THIS TOTALS------------$5,550

Remember friends, this is assuming that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each.  Dare to think for a moment what would
happen if everyone got 20 people to participate!  Some people get
100's of recruits!  THINK ABOUT IT!

By the way, your cost to participate in this is practically nothing.
You obviously already have an internet connection and email is FREE!!!
REPORT#3 will show you the best methods for finding people who will buy 
your reports, and it will how to reach thousands of hot prospects!

REMEMBER:  Approx. 150,000 new people get online monthly!

      ORDER YOUR REPORTS NOW!!!


*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******

THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS!  Send for the three reports IMMEDIATELY,
so you will have them when the orders start coming in because:
When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested 
product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal &amp; Lottery Laws, 
Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, Section 3005 in the U.S. 
Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received."

*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

*  Be patient and persistent with this program.  If you follow the           instructions exactly the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCE$$!

*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF THAT YOU CAN SUCCEED!


*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******

The check point that guarantees your success is simply this:
You MUST receive 20 orders for REPORT #1!  THIS IS A MUST!  If
you don't within two weeks, advertise more and send out more programs
until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at
least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, advertise more and send
out more programs until you do.  Once you have received 100, or more
orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because you will be on your way
to the BANK!  -OR-  You can DOUBLE your efforts!

REMEMBER:  Every time your name is moved down on the list you are in
front of a DIFFERENT report, so you can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS
by what report people are ordering from you. IT'S THAT EASY!!!

NOTE:  IF YOU NEED HELP with starting a business, registering a business
name, how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the 
Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and answers to questions.  Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.

        



           ******* T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S *******
 
This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the
rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work,you'll lose a lot of money.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.  If you are a fellow Christian and are in financial trouble like I was, consider this a sign.  I DID!
                                            Good Luck &amp; God Bless You,
                                     Sincerely, Minister Chris Johnson

P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,500) looks
like piled up on the kitchen table?...IT'S AWESOME!


My name is Frank.  My wife Doris and I live in Bel-Air, MD.
I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make
pretty good money.  When I received the program I grumbled to Doris
about receiving "junk mail"!  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting
my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it
wouldn't work.  Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, and was ready
to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work...
well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50
responses.  Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills!
I was stunned.  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't 
work...I AM a believer now.  I have joined Doris in her "little" hobby. I did have seven more years until retirement,  but I think of the "rat race" andit's not for me...We owe it all to MLM.
                                              Frank T., Bel-Air, MD
 
I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you. 
Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in.  I even
checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal.  
It definitely is!  IT WORKS!!!
                                           Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

This is the only realistic money-making offer I've ever received.  I 
participated because this plan truly makes sense. I was surprised
when the $5.00 bills started filling my mail box. By the time it tapered
off I had received over 8,000 orders with over $40,000 in cash.  Dozens
of people have sent warm personal notes too, sharing the news of their
good fortunes!  It's been WONDERFUL.
                                              Carl Winslow Tulsa, OK
 
 
This plan works like GANG-BUSTERS!! So far I have had 9,735 total orders
OVER $48,000!!!  I hope I have sparked your own excitement, if you follow
the program exactly, you could have the same success I have, if not better.
Your success is right around the corner, but you must do a little work.
                                                   Good Luck!  G. Bank
 
Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make
up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money
back.  Boy I was surprised when I found my medium-size post office box
crammed with orders.  After that it got so over-loaded that I had to
start picking up my mail at the window.  I'll make more money this
year than any 10 years of my life before.  The nice thing about this
deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people live.
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
                                             Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI

I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later
I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I
didn't delete this one!...I made $41,000 on the first try!!
                                                 D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN
 
This is my third time to participate in this plan.  We have
quit our jobs, and quite soon we will buy a home on the beach and live
off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan
will work for you is if you do it.  For your sake, and for your family's
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Remember, when you order
your four reports, SEND CASH.  Checks have to clear the bank and create
too many delays.  Good luck and happy spending!

Typically when I look at a money-making deal I want to
know if the company is strong, will it be here when it's time for
my big pay off.  In this crazy thing there is no company intervention
for management to blow it.  Just people like me ordering directly
from the source!  Interesting...I had a couple of projects I'd been
trying to fund to no avail so I thought; Why not give it a try?  Well
