&gt; 
&gt; Adam, one aspect of your suggestion puzzles me:
&gt; 	One thing which concerns me most is KNOWING when a message I send
&gt; (or receive) could be read by someone else. The PGP CMR scheme makes this
&gt; very clear: if there is an extra CMR key, the message may be read by
&gt; whomever controls that key, if not, only the recipient may decrypt the
&gt; message.
&gt; 	If, however, the message is secretly re-encrypted to a corporate
&gt; storage key AFTER it is received, I will never know that.

You will if you mark the key with this information.

This is the same approach PGP is already using to provide the GAK
compliant implementation of corporate access to stored emails.

&gt; The reality is that:
&gt; 	1) Organizations have a legitimate need to recover information. You
&gt; can argue about this as much as you want. 

I'm not arguing.  Of course they do.

What I _am_ arguing is that in designing systems to provide companies
with data recovery mechanisms that you should a) not weaken security
more than necessary, and b) that it would be nice if you used a method
which doesn't introduce GAK compliancy for communications keys.

I presented I think in plenty of detail an alternate mechanism which
is both non-GAK compliant, and more secure.  So what is the problem?
Is there a technical flaw in my solution?

&gt; A great many organizations will simply NOT INSTALL systems which do
&gt; not accommodate this. If businesses, law firms and many other
&gt; organizations will not use PGP, we will not have a viable standard.

Agreed 100%.  This is why I went to great pains to demonstrate
precisely how you could achieve recovery of stored messages in a more
secure and non-GAK compliant way.

&gt; which are easy to use and administer, which balance the rights of
&gt; the individual against those of the organization, and which do not
&gt; mislead people inside OR OUTSIDE of the organization.

my proposed mechanism for stored email recovery copes with all that.

&gt; 	This means, I believe, that they should NEVER INVOLVE HIDDEN BACK
&gt; DOORS THAT USERS ARE NOT AWARE OF.

Agreed.  You can flag backdoors with either solution.

&gt; PGP Inc. has tried to work through these issues in a new way. I think that
&gt; we have agonized through a lot of trade-offs and come up with something
&gt; that will really work -- and work well.

It works well enough, but it could be made much more secure, by
separating storage key functionality from transient message key
functionality.  This would also give you the chance to resolve the
articificially created need for GAK compliancy, which arises because
you are being forced by this lack of distinction between key
functionalities to use one key for both long term storage and what
should be transient communications key usage.

&gt; 	There is always the danger that someone is going to use your tools
&gt; in ways that you do not approve of. We are trying to make it as easy as
&gt; possible for people to do the "right" thing, and to discourage them from
&gt; doing the "wrong" thing (like secret snooping).
&gt; 	 With regard to GAK, the objective should be to accommodate
&gt; legitimate corporate needs without setting in place the foundation for GAK.

If that is PGP's aim, they failed most miserably.

&gt; We have tried very hard to do this by creating the foundation for a highly
&gt; flexible and decentralized approach which allows different organizations to
&gt; do things in very different ways. We have also tried to keep everything
&gt; very visible so that every party to a conversation knows exactly how
&gt; "private" that conversation is.

Decentralised control is good, of course, but the pgp5.5 and SMTP
policy enforcer is a ready to roll GAK system.  

The visibility principle is good but is an entirely separable issue.

&gt; 	I think that the sort of thing that PGP Inc is doing is the best
&gt; defense against GAK. It knocks the pins out from under the argument being
&gt; used in this country that corporate message recovery requires a key escrow
&gt; infrastructure, 

Yes, it is better than a government arranged "key recovery" key
infrastructure.

&gt; and will almost certainly lead to a wide variety of
&gt; organization-specific implementations that will be jealously guarded
&gt; and very difficult to corral. I cannot imagine your 80% scenario
&gt; working in the U.S. where there are so many small and medium-sized
&gt; organizations and so much concern about government intrusion. 

If the OpenPGP standard is to include the GAK compliancy features, and
these competing systems use this standard, as long as the sum of the
OpenPGP compliant systems gets to 80% (or whatever) it doesn't matter
whether this is mostly provided by PGP, or mostly by GAK sellout
companies like IBM, or TIS.  It is a dangerous development to have a
largely fielded compatible set of GAK compliant products, whoever the
providers are.

Email encryption needs to be standardised, otherwise people can't talk
to each other.  This suggests to me that one standard _will_ evolve as
the winner, or if there are other standards, they will be backwards
compatible to this main standard.  A very related example of this kind
of principle in action is the fact that most secured web traffic is
secured by Netscape's SSL.

&gt; I do worry a little more about countries like France, but I have yet
&gt; to see any guaranteed "safe" alternative (including yours) that the
&gt; French Government is likely to accept.

The French Government used require licenses for crypto, which were
hard to come by, and crypto without licenses was illegal.  In that
framework you couldn't see them liking PGP period.

More recently they have been swaying towards allowing crypto without
licenses, but only if it is GAK compliant.  PGP 5.5 &amp; SMTP policy
enforcer should be a sell out.  Maybe y'all should pitch it to the
French government and SCSII (their NSA).

&gt; 	I am very interested in seeing criticism and suggestions for
&gt; improvement and would like to see this discussed and debated as openly as
&gt; possible. In particular, I would be interested in how one could reconcile
&gt; your scheme of separate transmission and storage keys with my concern that
&gt; everyone party to an exchange always be informed about who might be able to
&gt; read that exchange.

That's simple: you already have the mechanism, just put one of those
attributes Jon described on the key stating this fact.

&gt; However, I think that some of this discussion should be separated from the
&gt; Open PGP discussion. NO ONE wants to build any sort of mandatory message
&gt; recovery scheme into the base Open PGP specification. PGP Inc itself is
&gt; committed to always providing a base client software product which does not
&gt; implement message recovery keys.

Glad to hear it.  Can we take it from that that PGP won't be arguing
for the GAK compliancy flag Jon Callas described to be part of the
standard then?  This is needed for said non "message recovery" base
client product to also be OpenPGP compliant.

&gt; 	The key structure needs to be flexible enough to accommodate all
&gt; kinds of uses we cannot now envisage. Yes, I believe that CMR keys should
&gt; be supported -- as should a lot of other things we need to talk about.

CMR keys and the way that PGP has designed their associated flags and
the SMTP policy enforcer app are what make PGP GAK compliant.  

Also there are clear security advantages to _never_ send
communications encrypted to two keys.  There are clear security
advantages to separating the functionality of storage and
communications keys.  Communications keys are the most sensitive of
all, and should have the shortest life times.  In some applications
this could be minutes.

&gt; Finally, let's dispense with the non-productive PGP Inc- bashing. We
&gt; founded this company to take something which was going to die because it
&gt; had no company behind it, and push it forward. PGP Inc was the first step
&gt; in that process. Open PGP is the next step.

The PGP bashing PGP observes is an attempt by the pro-privacy crypto
community to influence PGP to re-think the GAK compliancy, and to
point out the more secure way to implement corporate recovery of
stored email messages without GAK compliancy.

I reserve the right to bash any company which attempts to field GAK
compliant software.

&gt; 	Most companies are very ambivalent about "open" standards. Most of
&gt; the time, "open" to them means something which they control and everyone
&gt; else adheres to. PGP Inc, on the other hand, is very committed to the
&gt; spirit of open standards. We understand very well that we will only be
&gt; successful if there is an open and completely interoperable international
&gt; standard.
&gt;
&gt; 	I also want to assure you that all of the things we do get
&gt; extensively debated within PGP. Thus far, we have always been able to work
&gt; out consensus decisions which, I believe, are more sophisticated and better
&gt; thought-out for that debate. In all of this I have never heard ANYONE at
&gt; PGP Inc. suggest that the company add any feature or capability to the
&gt; software in order to appease any government agency. GAK is just as scary to
&gt; us as it is to you.

If PGP wants to make an additional stance against GAK here are my
recommendations:

1. remove GAK compliancy fields
2. scrap SMTP GAK compliancy policy enforcer app
3. separate storage and communications keys 
4. use shorter lived communications keys giving forward secrecy
5. implement corporate recovery of stored mail folders with escrowed
   storage keys

Forward secrecy is _the_ strongest statement you could possibly make
against GAK.
