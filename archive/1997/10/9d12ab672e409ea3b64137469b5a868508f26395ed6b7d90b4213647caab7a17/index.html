PLEASE EXCUSE THE INTRUSION. BUT, THIS INFORMATION MAY BE OF 
GREAT INTEREST TO YOU...

How would you like to BORROW $59,000 and NEVER have to 
repay the LOAN?

If you answered YES, and who wouldn't, then I would like 
to invite you to join a very SPECIAL group of people.
The FINANCIAL FRIENDS NETWORK.

The FINANCIAL FRIENDS NETWORK is an ever expanding international
group of GENEROUS and CARING people who WILL automatically
receive $59,000 LOANS, that they NEVER have to repay. 
All of our members are hard working, family-oriented people, 
with one common goal that unites us all. We are committed 
to generating income, to provide the neccessities and the 
comforts for ourselves and our families.

Let us show you exactly how our UNIQUE, HONEST and PROFESSIONALLY
MANAGED program, automatically LOANS YOU $59,000.

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:

Just LOAN 1 existing member $20 (which is your lifetime membership fee)
and THAT'S IT!!!    WE DO EVERTHING ELSE FOR YOU!

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JOIN US TO RECEIVE YOUR $59,000 LOAN!

IT'S REALLY AMAZING HOW EASY THIS IS AND HOW BEAUTIFULLY IT WORKS!

We can assure you that this is a LEGAL and LEGITIMATE offer and
complies with US law, title 18, sections 1302 &amp; 1341. After all,
who hasn't LOANED a FRIEND money before! And, we don't even expect
YOU to repay us.

HERE'S HOW TO JOIN:

1) Fill out the membership application at the bottom of this letter.
2) Send us your application along with $20, your lifetime membership fee.
AND THAT'S IT, WE'LL DO EVERYTHING ELSE FOR YOU!

HOW AND WHEN DO YOU RECEIVE YOUR LOAN:

ONLY the member in the #1 position RECEIVES YOUR LOAN/membership fee.
(SEE MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION) The FINANCIAL FRIENDS NETWORK will 
then remove the name of the person in the #1 position and will then add 
YOUR name and YOUR assigned number to the #5 position. The FINACIAL 
FRIENDS NETWORK will then enroll new members for you, as we are currently 
doing for an existing member, right now. Those collected membership fees 
are then forwarded to YOU, as the member in the #1 position.

THE FINANCIAL FRIENDS NETWORK WILL CONTINUOUSLY AND VIGOROUSLY 
ENROLL NEW MEMBERS UNTIL EACH EXISTING MEMBER HAS "SPONSORED" 
5 NEW MEMBERS. BY DOING THIS, NO MEMBER CAN FAIL!

THIS SERVICE ALONE IS WORTH MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN THE SMALL $20
LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP FEE!

CALCULATION OF LOAN AMOUNT:

Position 5: We enroll 5 new members for YOU -          1 X 5 = 5
Position 4: We enroll 5 new members for them -         5 X 5 = 25
Position 3: We enroll 5 new members for them -        25 X 5 = 125
Position 2: We enroll 5 new members for them -       125 X 5 = 600
Position 1: We enroll 5 new members for them -       600 X 5 = 3000

Those 3000 new members LOAN YOU $20 EACH, for a total of $60,000, 
less a $1000 loan processing fee, retained by FINANCIAL FRIENDS NETWORK.
This is how we make a profit and it enables us to continuously increase 
our membership. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT!

When YOUR name reaches the #1 position, usually in 3-4 months, 
YOU will then start to receive YOUR LOAN. YOUR LOANS will be automatically 
forwarded to you on the 1st and 15th of each month, until YOU receive 
YOUR entire $59,000 LOAN. Any overages will be automatically repositioned 
to the next member on the list.
(We never know exactly how many people will respond to each 
specific mailing)

Almost EVERYBODY JOINS our exclusive network due to it's LOW, LOW 
lifetime membership fee and it's HIGH, HIGH rate of return. 
Thousands of new members are joining monthly.

There are over 150,000 new people getting on the Internet each week. 
This provides us a vast and ever expanding market to tap into.
THAT'S WHY THIS OPPORTUNITY IS SUCH A FANTASTIC SUCCESS!

Nobody could blame you if you are having some reservations about joining 
our exclusive membership offer. But PLEASE, don't let your fears and past 
disappointments keep you from allowing YOURSELF and YOUR FAMILY to 
benefit from this ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY!

Financial security is the one basic need of all people. Without it, 
it's difficult to survive. IMAGINE WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH A $59,000 LOAN,
THAT YOU NEVER HAVE TO REPAY!

The FINANCIAL FRIENDS NETWORK allows ALL of it's members the opportunity
to become FINANCIALLY SECURE. And, YOUR lifetime membership fee is so 
LOW, there's no strain on YOUR budget!

PLEASE don't confuse the FINANCIAL FRIENDS NETWORK with any other
money programs that are DOOMED from the start. They make no guarantees, 
they want YOU to do ALL the work and they want YOU to absorb ALL the cost.
They'll even tell you that YOUR SUCCESS depends solely on YOU! As a member 
of the FINANCIAL FRIENDS NETWORK, We do ALL the work and WE absorb all 
the cost. YOU just sit back and collect YOUR LOAN.
WHAT COULD BE EASIER?

MONEY BACK GUARANTEE:

If at any time, you would like to cancel your membership, we will refund you 
your full lifetime membership fee, no questions asked.
NOW YOUR MEMBERSHIP IS RISK FREE!

WE'RE SURE YOU'LL HAVE TO AGREE, THAT THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL 
OPPORTUNITY OF IT'S KIND, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RISK!

PLEASE DON'T LET THIS OPPORTUNITY PASS YOU BY. IT WILL PROBABLY 
BE THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY!
