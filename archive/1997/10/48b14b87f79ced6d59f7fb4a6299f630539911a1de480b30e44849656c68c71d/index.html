&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. The Doors Box Set is in the stores TODAY!!!

Today, October 28th, 1997 is the first day that millions of Doors fans will finally be able to get their hands on a copy of The Doors long awaited box set. The media blitz across the nation has caused such a surge on our web site that it slowed downloads down to a halt earlier yesterday. Thanks to the quick response of our ISP (Fibernet, Inc) we have bolstered the site to withstand anything that can hit us today!  Check us out at     
              http://www.doors.com
Included in all the promotion is a new three hour long syndicated radio show (Without a Safety Net) about The Doors aired within the last two days and hundreds of classic rock radio stations played Doors block parties all weekend long to honor this auspicious occasion.  

Those of you who live in NYC might want to call Tower Records for details because all three Doors will be signing box sets today! For those fans back in Los Angeles be sure to go to the Tower Records on Sunset next Saturday for the same opportunity.   On a personal note: I would love to buy any spare copies of  the box set that are signed by all three Doors, so if you get the chance... why not help me out and help pay for your own box set at the same time! Email me for details at: kerry@doors.com

For those of you asking about price: The list price is $69 but many large record chains are celebrating the release with special prices... The lowest I've seen so far is $45

Ever since the set list was released (http://www.doors.com/sd.html) I've had tons of emails asking questions about the box set...but the one question that I have been asked repeatedly and had no answer for was why the song "Paris Blues" whose lyrics appeared in Danny Sugerman's "Illustrated Lyrics" book was not to be on the box set song line up?  So at the press conference earlier this month, I grabbed the microphone and asked the question.   Ray offered an explanation saying that the song just didn't make the cut. Plain and simple.

But don't worry!   The box set kicks a big ass!  I can't even tell you how excited that I am for the fans to hear some of the incredible tunes represented on the set. PICK IT UP!   IT'S AT YOUR LOCAL CD STORE TODAY!!!!



&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Doors Web Ring Ranks 15th Largest!

The WebRing of The Doors which is sponsored by The Doors Collectors Magazine has now skyrocketed to being the 15th largest music related WebRing on the net!  We recently too k out the Hanson WebRing (MmmmBop!  Two thumbs up for this!!!) Check out the WebRing of The Doors at:
http://www.doors.com/webring/



&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3.  LYCOS TOP 5% OF ALL WEB SITES NOW INCLUDES OUR SITE!

The Doors Collectors Magazine (http://www.doors.com) has made it to the Lycos Top 5% of all web sites!  Check out our site's review below. I think most of it is pretty good!:

This online version of the print magazine contains a trunk full of articles, interviews and beautiful loser trinkets. The Stones have a credit card; the Doors have an e-mail address: doors.com. It's not all just Lizard King worship, either. DCM focuses on the band's music, life and career rather than simply deifying Jim Morrison. True believers can trade concert tapes, check in on tribute bands, and read back issues. Big Picture projects: mounting a campaign to strike Morrison's criminal record for his alleged exhibitionism on a Miami stage. A slavish yet seductive entrance to the Doors web ring.
