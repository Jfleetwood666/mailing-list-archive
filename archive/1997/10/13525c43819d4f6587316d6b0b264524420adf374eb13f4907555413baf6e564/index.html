36 Year Old Man Discovers How To . . .
 . . GET $500 IN YOUR HANDS As Soon As Next Week!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The truth is stranger than fiction..."How I Make $200.00 A Day, 
Sitting At My Kitchen Table, In My Underwear!"

A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO 
"NETWORK MARKETING" TOOK ME FROM BROKE TO 
$200.00 A DAY,WORKING FROM HOME,IN ONLY A FEW 
MONTHS - AND I'M CONVINCED ANYBODY CAN COPY 
WHAT I'M DOING!

(Why would any sane person reveal this kind of secret, if it 
was true? Read my message and find out.)

I'm 36 years old. My wife and I have 3 boys, all terrors. We 
live in the suburbs. I'm writing this article, sitting at my kitchen 
table in my boxer shorts and a T-shirt; I have  achieved the 
"fantasy" of making a ton of money from my own successful 
home-based business. I know it'll be tough for you to believe 
that you can do what I'm doing. But I hope you'll give me a 
chance. I may just be the guy to change your life around in 
a big, big way.

IF YOU HAD TOLD ME A YEAR AGO THAT I'D BE WRITING 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS, I'D HAVE LAUGHED IN YOUR 
FACE - BUT HERE I AM.

There is nothing more rewarding and fulfilling than owning 
and 	operating your own sucessful business. No where 
else on Earth can you get this kind of independence, security 
and freedom. Work when you want to work. Earn what you 
want to earn . . .  

You Can Have All This and MORE With Oour System - NOW!


With this system you are PROTECTED BY A SIMPLE 
GUARANTEE. And I would be an idiot to risk ruining a $
20,000-A-MONTH business to steal pocket change from you. 
Wouldn't that be incredibly stupid? 
So here's my guarantee to you: 

If you aren't 100% satisfied after receiving your first check, 
you can just return your check and your membership package 
and I will gladly refund your money! I simply will not have 
an unhappy member!

The bottom line is I want you to be as successful as I am. 
I want you to make moeny. I want you to get handfuls of 
checks. And I wanna see the look on your banker's face 
when you shove an envelope full of checks into his face!!!

I want to help you overcome all the obstacles. I want to 
teach you the "jealously guarded" secrets. I want to get 
YOU started with the network marketing company of 
the 21st century!!!


With this fast-growing company....

* You don't have to recruit friends and family!

* You don't have to wonder what to do! They maintain a 
professional staff of over 50 trained marketing consultants 
equipped to answer 	any and all questions and fully 
explain this  wonderful opportunity to your prospect's 
satisfaction (and your banker's delight!)

* You don't have to send out millions of letters!

* You don't have to call prospects on the phone!

* Your only job is to promote a toll-free 800 number!
 And if you can do this simple thing, YOU can make 
 YOUR FORTUNE!


Forget all the hooplah: the "rich" are not going to bear 
the burden of all the new taxes needed to cover social 
security shortfalls,healthcare,etc. - it's the middle class, 
middle income "wage slave' they have their sights on. 

YOU are the target. The only real way to fight back is to 
make so much darned money that what you have AFTER 
the damage is still fantastic. That's where I am. A whole lot 
of people join but never do anything about it, and I can't help 
that. But there ARE people just like you, who join, and then 
go on to make VERY big incomes. 

IT'S UP TO YOU. You can sit there and watch helplessly 
as Washington chews up your take home pay...or you can 
chase a silly pie-in-the-sky idea get rich quick scheme... 
or you can let me teach you a proven, truly practical way 
to jump up to such a HUGE INCOME that you can sit 
back and laugh at the politicians.Which is it going to be?
