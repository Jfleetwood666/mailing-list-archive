&gt;    Dow drowns in tech sell-off

&gt;    Blue chips shed over 130 points in second straight day of steep
&gt;    declines

&gt;    October 24, 1997: 5:37 p.m. ET

&gt;    NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Tumbling technology stocks and lingering concerns
&gt;    over the fate of the Hong Kong market dealt a heavy blow on U.S. stock
&gt;    markets Friday with the Dow industrials suffering severe losses for
&gt;    the second day in a row.
&gt;    [INLINE] Dow Jones industrial average closed 132.36 points lower at
&gt;    7,715.41 after starting the day as high as 7,939.61. The blue-chip
&gt;    index lost 0.75 percent Friday and ended the week 1.69 percent, or
&gt;    132.61 points, below last week's close.
&gt;    [INLINE] In broader markets, the technology-laden Nasdaq was down
&gt;    20.33, or 1.22 percent, at 1,650.92, 15.96 points lower on the week.
&gt;    The S&amp;P 500 index fell 9.06 at 941.63, ending the week 2.54 points
&gt;    down.
&gt;    [INLINE] On the New York Stock Exchange declines led advances, 1,508
&gt;    to 1,337, with almost 680 million shares changing hands.
&gt;    [INLINE] Friday's market collapse was triggered by a heavy sell-off in
&gt;    technology stocks after several downgrades in semiconductor stocks and
&gt;    a plant-delay announcement by Intel.
&gt;    [INLINE] Spectrian (SPCT) led losers trading on the Nasdaq, plunging
&gt;    15-7/8 to close at 26-1/4. The stock was downgraded by Morgan Stanley
&gt;    to "neutral" from "outperform" and by UBS Securities to "hold" from
&gt;    "buy" on concerns over future orders. Those worries appeared to
&gt;    outweigh the company's report of 60 cents per share in quarterly
&gt;    earnings, beating Wall Street estimates of 53 cents. The company makes
&gt;    power amplifiers for wireless communications firms.
&gt;    [INLINE] UBS downgraded several other semiconductor stocks, because of
&gt;    concerns over the Asian currency crisis' effect on sales. Among these
&gt;    stocks, Applied Materials (AMAT), closed 3-3/4 lower at 33-1/4,
&gt;    topping the most actively traded list on Nasdaq with over 61 million
&gt;    of the company's shares changing hands. Novellus (NVLS), down 3 at
&gt;    48-3/8, and CFM Technologies (CFMT), off 5-5/8 at 23, were also in the
&gt;    list of downgraded companies and suffered declines.
&gt;    [INLINE] Other technology stocks that took a beating Friday included
&gt;    Intel (INTC), down 1-7/8 at 80, after the company said it would
&gt;    postpone the opening of a $1.3 billion Texas semiconductor plant.
&gt;    Intel said a decline in demand for "flash" memory chips was the reason
&gt;    behind the delay. The plant is now expected to open in late 2000.
&gt;    [INLINE] Earlier in the day, an almost 7 percent gain in Hong Kong's
&gt;    Hang Seng index following Thursday's record point decline spread over
&gt;    into European markets and later also on Wall Street. The Hang Seng
&gt;    gained 718.04 points to close at 11,144.34 in what was its
&gt;    second-biggest one-day point gain.
&gt;    [INLINE] But the good news from Asia was soon outweighed by concerns
&gt;    over the future direction of the Hong Kong market. This, coupled with
&gt;    Wall Street's technology woes, led to a tumble in other world markets
&gt;    too. In London, the FTSE 100 index closed off 21.3 at 4,970.2, and in
&gt;    Paris the CAC-40 ended down 7.84 at 2,849.03. Frankfurt's DAX, the
&gt;    only major index to finish the day in positive territory, gained 73.61
&gt;    to 4,050.87.
&gt;    [INLINE] U.S. bond markets also had a choppy day Friday as the Hong
&gt;    Kong-inspired flight to quality came to an abrupt end. The benchmark
&gt;    30-year Treasury closed 12/32 higher to yield 6.28 percent after
&gt;    testing both sides of unchanged.
&gt;    [INLINE] Gold company shares weighed on the market as well, down
&gt;    steeply following news of a Swiss proposal to sell 1,400 metric tons
&gt;    of gold as part of an overhauling of the Swiss constitution. Shares of
&gt;    Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 3-3/8 to 41-9/16, Barrick Gold (ABX) dropped
&gt;    1-15/16 to 21-5/8, and Homestake Mining (HM) was off 1-7/16 at
&gt;    13-13/16.
&gt;    [INLINE] Among other market movers, cosmetics giant Avon (AVP) was up
&gt;    sharply after its stock was upgraded by several Wall Street firms.
&gt;    Smith Barney raised its rating of the company to "buy" from
&gt;    "outperform," Goldman Sachs raised it to "outperform" from "perform"
&gt;    and PaineWebber raised it to "attractive" from "neutral." Avon shares
&gt;    closed 6-7/8 higher at 73-3/4.
&gt;    [INLINE] Other net gainers included Amazon .com (AMZN). Shares in the
&gt;    on-line book retailer rose 6-5/16 to 60-5/16 because its third-quarter
&gt;    loss was lower than expected.
&gt;    [INLINE] Topping the NYSE's most-active-shares list: Boeing (BA),
&gt;    which slipped 9/16 to close at 48-1/2. The company reported an
&gt;    expected loss of 72 cents a share in the third quarter, compared with
&gt;    a profit of 48 cents in the third quarter last year. Boeing's loss
&gt;    included a $1.6 billion charge related to severe production delays.
&gt;    [INLINE] IBM (IBM), after posting gains early in the day, succumbed to
&gt;    the technology sector's decline and lost 2-1/4 to 98-1/8. Among other
&gt;    stocks that took a hit were Texas Instruments (TXN) which plummeted 9
&gt;    to close at 111-7/8.
&gt;    [INLINE] Computer retailer Gateway 2000 (GTW) shares were down 1/2 at
&gt;    30-3/4 after the company reported a loss of $107.1 million, or 68
&gt;    cents a share, after the market close Thursday. The loss included a
&gt;    $113.8 million pre-tax charge and compares with a profit of $60.7
&gt;    million, or 39 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Link to top
