In &lt;199710131652.RAA02526@server.test.net&gt;, on 10/13/97 
   at 05, Adam Back &lt;aba@dcs.ex.ac.uk&gt; said:

&gt;&gt; &gt;I also personally prefer people to send me keys in email, because the pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;per second phone lines here at home mean that I tend want to avoid doing
&gt;&gt; &gt;too many online key lookups, so I think this would be an individually
&gt;&gt; &gt;useful feature.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I do my keylookups automatically durning the msg filtering process which
&gt;&gt; is done in parallel to the message Dl's. 

&gt;A clever optimisation to be sure.

&gt;&gt; The outbound message lookups are a little more time consuming but is
&gt;&gt; compensated by fewer keys to look for both because fewer messages on
&gt;&gt; the outbound side and the use of key caches on the client machine
&gt;&gt; for the most used keys for sig verification and encryption. 

&gt;I don't have a key cache, and my keyring is only 216k.  But I'm curious
&gt;about your automated process .. are you also checking all signatures that
&gt;you can by downloading the keys and checking out the WoT for all received
&gt;mailing list traffic etc?  This would cleary result in a much bigger key
&gt;ring.

For the inbound processing of mail I have the following automated
processes:

- -- Messages is downloaded and checked to see if it is a PGP Message (This
is handled by the mailers filters).

- -- If the message is signed the keyid of signature is extracted from the
sig-block and a lookup is performed on the index table for both the users
pubring &amp; sig_cache.

- -- If the key is not found in either then the message is placed in a queue
and a keylookup thread is spawned.

- -- There is a setup for which servers and how many to try when doing the
lookups.

- -- If no key is found on the servers then a canned e-mail message is sent
to the sender requesting his keys. The message is taken out of the queue,
marked that no key was found and that a request had been sent out.

- -- If a key is found it is added to the key cache (sig_cache.pgp). Then
normal sig verification is performed.

- -- After X amount of hits on a key in the cache the key is flagged as a
commonly used key for the user so he can pursue authenticating the key (no
sense in going through a lengthy authentication procedure for a key that
is only used once).

- -- Attached keys are detached from messages and stored in new.pgp keyring
(auto adding of keys to ones keyring is a Badthing (TM) ).

- -- Encrypted messages are decrypted.

All PGP output is appended to the bottom of the message so the info is
there when the user opens the message. If a message is in MIME format then
the below is appended as MIME attachments using text/X-PGPCheck MIME type.
A sample is provided below:

PGPRC=1
PGPRC2=1


&gt;&gt; Also logging of e-mail addresses that do not use PGP cuts down on
&gt;&gt; the number of lookups needed

&gt;Good optimisation.  It sounds really as if your OS/2 setup is more
&gt;advanced than a lot of other stuff around.

- -- For the outbound messages the following procedures are in place:

- -- All messages are signed with the user having an option of disabling
this signature either on a per message basis (through the use of a message
template at creation time) or default conditions can be set in the filter
no to call the signing script (things like don't sign messages to
majordomo, or messages going to remailers, ...ect)

- -- Outbound messages can be flagged for encryption on a per message basis
(through the use of a message template at creation time) or default
conditions can be set in a special default.ndx file used by the encryption
script.

- -- The encryption script first extracts all the e-mail addresses from the
To:, Cc:, &amp; Bcc: lines.

- -- It then does a lookup on the default.ndx table. This is where several
issues are resolved.

    1) No key for address. An address can be flagged as a no-encrypt
address. This is mostly for mailing lists and receivers that do not use
PGP.

    2) Default key for address. An address can be flagged as encrypt and
the keyid for that address is included in the entry for that address. This
handles things like userid does not match the e-mail address for the
person you are sending to (change of address, ect...). Also the issue of
multiple keys having the same e-mail address are handled (their can be 5
keys all with the address john_doe@domain.com in the userid fields but
only one is the real john_doe@domain.com that you are talking to).

    3) Always encrypt flag. You can flag an address to alway encrypt too
regardless of wether the message was flagged for encryption at creation
time. (hmmmm starting to get into the realm of policy enforcement here
&lt;g&gt;).

- -- Unless an address is flagged as no-encrypt then a lookup on the keyring
indexes for both the pubring and crypt_cache are performed.

- -- If and address is not found then a keyring lookup is performed. A
separate cache is kept for the encrypted keys and a similar process of
flagging frequently used keys is in place as with the sig_cache.

- -- now that all the addresses are processed 3 copies of the message are
created:

    1) Encrypted message. This message is sent to all the addresses where
valid keys have been found.

    2) Plain Text message. This message is sent to all addresses where
they have been flagged no-encrypt in the default.ndx.

    3) Error message. This message is returned to the message editor and
the user is informed why the message could not be encrypted and then it is
up to him to resolve the problem. Most common errors are no key found for
the address and multiple keys with the same address found. Both these
conditioned can be resolved by making the proper entries in the
default.ndx file.

        3A) There is a setting flag that tells the script not to split the
message as above and error the complete message unless all addresses can
be encrypted to.

        3B) their is an exception option on 3A where a split message is
not in error if the only addresses with no_keys are flagged as public
distribution (mailing list, newsgroups, ...ect).

    4) BCC messages. Bcc's create a unique problem to the encrypt to
multiple recipients function. Because of the format of the encryption
block the list of keys used to encrypt is known to all who care to look.
This goes against the purpose of a BCC which is to hide a recipient from
the rest. In this case I create a separate message for each BCC and
encrypt that message with only the key for the BCC recipient.

    5) All split messages contain a X-Distribution list containing all the
e-mail addresses that the messages was sent to (minus the BCC's of
course).

I have allot more goodies implemented and/or working on but that should be
enough for one message (direct keyring manipulation, remailer support,
stamper support, PGP/MIME, balanced b-tree as keyring, ...ect). Much of
the optimization work I have been doing is for server side processing
useing very large keyrings (+20Mb) but that is another thread in itself.
Plus I have a PGP GUI which has many other features for key management &amp;
WOT not practical for the automated processing code.

&gt;My setup is GNU emacs with Pat LoPresti's mailcrypt.el PGP and remailer
&gt;support lisp extension for emacs RMAIL and emacs GNUS (newsreader).  I
&gt;love it to bits.  It is totally excellent.  It doesn't have a couple of
&gt;your optimisations, but other than that it's pretty good.  When you send
&gt;messages, if you don't have the key it will fetch it for you by trying
&gt;keyservers, then finger user@domain. It can snarf keys out of mail
&gt;messages, paste keys into them, sign, encrypt, check signatures, use
&gt;remailers (type I and mixmaster).

Sounds good except the retrieval of keys from the finger. This is a
serious weakpoint in your security. Say you have Adam who wishes to
communicate with Mary. He get's Mary's key from her .plan file via finger.
Eve has control of the server and replaces Mary's key with her own. Now
you encrypt message to Mary but you are using Eve's key. Eve decrypts the
message re-encrypts with Mary's and neither of you are the wiser. This is
also a weakness in the distributed key approach as it presents a single
source of failure unless some type of redundancy is built in. I know that
there are many issues involved in this and probably should be spun off
into a separate thread if you are interested in pursuing it (too many
disjointed subjects in one thread tends to become confusing).
