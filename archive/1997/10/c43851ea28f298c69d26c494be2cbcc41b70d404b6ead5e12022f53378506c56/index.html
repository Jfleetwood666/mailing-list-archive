Do You Know 3 People That Use Long Distance?
Dumb Question Huh?

If you GAVE those 3 people a FREE Business Kit including all the Necessary
Software, Do You Think They Might Know 3 People Who Use Long Distance?

What if You Told Them They Could:
Save on every Long Distance Call! (24 Hours a Day!) 
Long Distance Rates as low as 9.9 cents per minute&gt;
AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint can't touch this!

800/888 for your home!
Avoid calling home collect! Perfect for kids away at college 
or even use it to check your messages. Your cost for this is the same
9.9 cents per minute!
AT&amp;T charges a $10.00 monthly service fee for this feature.
It's ONLY $1.50 per month with us!

No-Surcharge Calling Card!
Save almost 90% with rates as low as 19 cents a minute!
(MCI, Sprint, and AT&amp;T charge 80 cents minimum surcharge per call.) 
Pick your own card number and PIN for convenience. 

One More Thing . . . Don't confuse THIS with phone "clubs" who charge
a monthly fee ($10-$50) for the "rights" to get a discount. 
Remember, you don't have to join anything to receive any of these
great communication services, like long distance, paging and calling cards! 

Introducing The Easiest, Most Profitable, and Fun Way to Not Only Save Money,
but to Work Part Time at Home and Get Paid!!!

Lets' Take a Look at the Realistic Income You Can Generate By Just Telling 3
People!!

You Tell 3 People about this offer = 3 people
Those 3 Tell 3 People about this = 9 people
Those 9 Tell 3 People about this = 27 people
Those 25 Tell 3 People about this=81 people
Those 81 Tell 3 People about this=243 people
Those 243 Tell 3 People about this=729 people
Those 729 Tell 3 People about this=2187 people
Those 2187 Tell 3 People about this=6561 people

Now add up all 8 levels of people to get = 9,840 people

YOU KNOW HAVE 9,840 PEOPLE ON YOUR SUCCESS TEAM

Now The Fun Part!!

We know just by human nature that people could spend an average of $25.00 per
month on Long Distance. Some people spend 10 times that, and others may not
spend any. For all practical purposes, lets say all 9,840 people spent only
$25.00 per month on Long Distance.

9,840 people x $25.00/month = $246,000/month on Long Distance!!

HERE'S WHERE YOUR REWARD COMES IN!!

Because You Told 3 People and got the ball rolling you are now paid 2%
commission on the total monthly phone bill in your team.

That's $246,000 Dollars X 2% Commissions

= $4,920.00/per month in your pocket!!!

WOULD THAT HELP INCREASE YOUR LIFESTYLE A BIT? 

YOU KNOW IT WOULD!! 

BUT TELLING 3 PEOPLE IS VERY CONSERVATIVE!!

What would your income be if you told 5 people?

I can't tell you, because you wouldn't beleive me!!

So is this for real, or am I just blowing smoke?

You Bet It's For Real!! People using Long Distance Is as natural as the air
we breath, and the food we eat. This can, and will happen if you do your
part!!

What is your part?

1.You need to Tell 3, Tell 4, Tell 5, etc. and spread around your ID#, 
mine is #AH603800

2.You need to work with your downline to make sure that they Tell 3, Tell 4,
Tell 5, etc.

3.You need to stay in touch and teach them how to do what you just did!!


My favorite saying is 

"Give a Man a Fish, and Feed Him For a Day!
Teach a Man to Fish, and Feed Him For Life!"

 
So What Do You Need to Get Started?
