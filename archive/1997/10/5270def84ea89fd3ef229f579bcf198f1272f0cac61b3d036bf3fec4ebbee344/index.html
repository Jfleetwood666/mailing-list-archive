&gt; The current system sends out a user's personal key, with a tag to say that
&gt; if I don't encrypt to the company as well, my mail will bounce. But think
&gt; about this: how often do I want to send email to a particular person in a
&gt; company, and ensure that only they see it? And how often do I want to send
&gt; mail to a particular group inside a company? All I want is to ensure that
&gt; I get a response from the company, I usually don't care who I talk to in the
&gt; process.

The CMR feature in pgp5.5 isn't so far intented to cope with this
scenario I think.  That's because pgp5.5 I understand can only
generate keys with one CMR request field.

What you're describing is an alternate use for CMR: to allow
sales@acme.com to have attached to it the request that messages to
that address be encrypted for all the sales people.

Well that seems reasonable in a way.  Still potentially dangerous in
that the NSA will soon enough be asking to be on every one's CMR list.

(As far as I can tell the next version (pgp6.0 or whatever) will
include capability to create keys with multiple CMR requests.  The
capability to handle them is already in pgp5.5 by all accounts.)

The other alternative is as you say: to have group keys which are
shared amongst the sales people.  There are problems with this in
managing the secure distribution of the shared key: sales manager
creates it, and emails securely to all sales team members?
Plausible I suppose.

Problem for both approaches is re-keying: what happens when Fred
leaves the sales team to work for a competitor.  Revoke the shared key
and start over?  Or with the CMR method, revoke just the CMR request
for Fred, and allow key servers to remove CMR requests when presented
with a suitable CMR request revocation cert?  (How often will senders
check key servers for revocation certs?)  Or have short expiries on
encryption-only keys (one per day?), so that they key update happens
soon enough anyway.  (pgp5.x allows for short lived encryption keys
directly because of the separation of signature and encryption keys,
the WoT applies to the signature key).

Really it seems to me that actually having half a dozen sales droids
sharing a key, or being able to decrypt a message because they are all
CMR enforced multiple crypto recipients is a security nightmare either
way :-)

Reckon it would be arguably more secure to have the SMTP policy
enforcer decrypt it for them, even.

Another option would be Matt Blaze's proxy encryption.  That allows
the owner of the sales@acme.com key (perhaps the sales manager) to
create proxy keys which can convert messages addressed to
sales@acme.com into messages addressed to fred@acme.com,
jane@acme.com, and the rest of the sales droids.  (I thought Dave
Wagner came up with an example of a public key proxy function for an
RSA or El Gamal variant or something).

With proxy encryption you still have to have the proxy keys somewhere,
but you could keep them out of Fred's hands by putting them on the
SMTP policy server for it to convert incoming traffic.  This seems to
be more secure than either approach.  And avoids the security risk of
having multiple long term encryption keys used to allow access to
communications traffic.

That way at least messages aren't coming over the wire addressed to
101 people.  And also you don't have to worry so much about quick
propogation of revocation certs.  And when someone leaves you can
remove their proxy key from the SMTP server.

The whole problem is really quite complex, and there are no easy
solutions to group secured mail access where people are leaving and
joining the group at short notice.  Proxy cryptography seems to add
something quite useful to this mix.

Some form of transport level security adds something to the mix also,
because then if you are using CMR keys, or even normal pgp2.x multiple
recipients, or you are using long term encryption keys (as PGP Inc
seems to be currently recommending with pgp5.x (recommended validity
setting of `forever')) at least old traffic isn't directly vulnerable.

Several people commented on using a forward secret TLS between SMTP
servers opportunisitically (if the SMTP server supports the extension,
then use it; if not fall back to current situation).

Even without any authentication, this is a win because the main threat
from government is massive eavesdropping and key word scanning, or
saving of targetted users mails for later key compromise.
Unauthenticated TLS still forces the attacker to use active attacks.
Authentication can be added later as part of IPSEC/IPv6 key
infrastructure.

Another method of authenticating TLS is to base the authentication on
the user's PGP WoT.  Include authentication information to the
delivery agent which is capable of TLS, which is also exchanged inside
the encryption envelope.  (Eg. transfer an authentication symmetric
key k1 inside the encryption envelope; send the local TLS capable SMTP
hub / SMTP policy enforcer the key k1.  The TLS forward secret key
negotiation can then be authenticated using this key.  The remote TLS
system can tack the authentication information on to the delivered
message, in a header, or otherwise, and the recipient can check the
authentication).

&gt; So PGP's "everything private unless you choose to make it public" system
&gt; seems backwards. Surely what we really need to meet these customer demands
&gt; is an "everything public (within the company) unless you choose to make it
&gt; private" system? That is, all mail to my department inside the company
&gt; should be encrypted to a department key, shared by all members, *unless*
&gt; it is confidential, in which case it should *only* be encrypted to me. 

I think what PGP are arguing for is ability to recover stored messages
even if they are intended for one recipient only.  As I think has been
established this can be acheived by storage recovery, without exposing
communications traffic to the associated risks.  It is possible that
there is an unstated perceived user requirement, that the messaging
standard be able to allow third party access to the communications
traffic directly.

Your description is another plausible permutation also, I think, which
has it's own merits and security/privacy/political abuse trade-offs.
