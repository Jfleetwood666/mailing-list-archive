   It was the week of finals, and obviously, everyone was stressing.
This happened in a big (+300) lecture class, it was some hard science
course with one of those real pain-in-the ass professors.  Everyone
taking this course had been dreading this final from the start. They all
knew they had no hope. There was one student in the class who felt
confident in the area if he could just take his time and work his way
through each problem.
   So, on the day of the final, he decided he would just take his time
on the test. The exam began, and he slowly paced himself, carefully
working out each problem. This was diffficult because the professor was
one of those guys who would obnoxiously yell to the class how much time
they had left every three minutes. He was just one of those guys who
needed a smack in the face.
   Finally, time was up, and the teacher told the class to stop, and to
bring their test papers down to his desk. With over three-hundred
people, this procedure took quite a while.  That one student just
continued working on his test. Eventually, ten extra minutes turned into
twenty, until the student was there for almost an hour after the exam
had ended. He looked at his paper, and decided he had completed the test
to his satisfaction, and he could now hand it in. He gathered his things
and walked down to the teachers desk.
   The professor was sitting at the desk, the tests were still sitting
on the desk in a neatly stacked pile, and it was clear he had just been
waiting for this student to finish so that he could tell him that he had
failed. The student reached his professors desk with a big smile on his
face. The professor said to him, "This test was due an hour ago. By
handing it in now it is considered late, and consequently, you fail."
   The student looked right at the professor and said to him "Do you
know who I am?"
   The professor clearly upset by his student's response said "What are
you talking about?"
   Again the student said, "Do you know who I am?" The professor
responded by saying no, of course not... Just as he said this, the
student lifted up half of the test papers still sitting on the teachers
desk. He casually slipped his test on the pile, and let the rest of the
tests fall naturally back onto the stack. He looked at his professor and
said "I didn't think so."
