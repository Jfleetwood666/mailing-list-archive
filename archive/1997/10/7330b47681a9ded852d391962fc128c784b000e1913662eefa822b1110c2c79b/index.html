 L'APRINA IS A LIQUEFIED TOPICAL ASPIRIN.

SPRAY IT ON WHERE IT HURTS!

IT REALLY WORKS!

SUPERIOR PAIN RELIEF
IN MINUTES FROM A REVOLUTIONARY 
TOPICAL PAIN RELIEVER THAT
DOES NOT DISTURB THE
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND HAS
NO ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS


A PROVEN  ANALGESIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY  with  Aloe Vera

                        REVOLUTIONARY PAIN RELIEF

Do you suffer with aches and pains from headaches, sports injuries, 
low back discomfort, arthritis, rheumatism, bursitis, or joint pain?
These, and many other kinds of pains and discomfort can now safely be
treated with a revolutionary, topical pain reliever called L'APRINA. 

L'APRINA  is simply a liquefied, topical aspirin, designed to be
applied wherever pain occurs. Many people will say it is not possible
to get pain relief from an external product; they say that true pain 
relievers-analgesics - have to be swallowed to be effective. Up to 
now, they were right, because all the other external pain relievers 
on the market did not do much except "disguised the pain" by warming
or cooling the area where applied.

However, L'APRINA is truly different. It works, and it works fast to
relieve all kinds of pain that people normally experience. Best of all
since you do not ingest it, L'APRINA has none of the side effects
associated with aspirin and other pain relievers that are taken
internally.

L'Aprina's main active ingredient is acetylsalicylic acid (commonly 
known as aspirin). It also contains extract from the Aloe Vera plant.
Using a special and highly secret formula, L'Aprina effectively
combines the analgesic power of aspirin  with the humectant properties
of Aloe Vera to produce pain killing and anti-inflammatory action
superior to any other external product. 

                            NO SIDE EFFECTS
Everybody knows there are lots of drugs and other products out there
that will relieve pain The big problem with all of them is that they
have to be taken orally, which means that they have to work through
the digestive system and the blood stream, and enter every organ and
tissue of the body. For many people, this leads to stomach or 
intestional distress from internal pain relievers, as well as more
serious, long term effects to their health.

Before L'APRINA  the  adverse side effects from internal pain
relievers were something you simply had to accept - there was
no effective alternative, However, with the arrival of L'APRINA
people now have a wonderful alternative to the treatment of pain.
L'APRINA is healther and safer because only a minuscule amount enters
the blood or organs of the body - and there are no adverse side
effects.

With L'APRINA if you have an injured foot, arthritis in your arms,
or an aching back, you can get quick relief by applying it where it
hurts and rubbing it in. No longer do you have to swallow a pain
reliever, putting medicine in your stomach, kidneys, heart and 
liver just to get relief from a headache, or pain in your feet, 
back, or arm, This revolutionary, but sinple, idea is what L'APRINA 
is all about.

                     EASY AND FAST RELIEF
L'APRINA is easy to apply with either its roll-on, squeeze or spray 
applicator. We recommend the painful area be doused liberally, 
then gently massaged until dry. This procedure should be repeated 
two or three times, depending on how sever the pain is. 
Do not worry about over use - you can't overdose with L'APRINA.

L'APRINA begins to relieve even the worst discomfort in minutes. 
You should begin to experience almost immediate relief after using 
L'APRINA and its analgesic action normally last six hours, and 
often longer. In addition, when used daily, L'APRINA often has a 
powerful cumulative effect, which allows many people to use less 
L'APRINA, less often, for continued pain relief. 

New uses for L'APRINA are being discovered everyday. In addition 
to the severe pain discomfort from broken bones, shingles, burns, 
migraine headaches, and the like L'APRINA is great for those 
discomforts people experience from sunburn, insect bites and 
strained muscles, just to name a few.

Keep a bottle in your office, home and car at all times. 
The compact roll-on bottle is perfect for purses and briefcases. 
Be sure to use L'APRINA on your children for those cuts, scrapes 
and bruises all children seem to get, L'APRINA IS SAFER and HEALTHER 
than any oral pain medication you can buy.
