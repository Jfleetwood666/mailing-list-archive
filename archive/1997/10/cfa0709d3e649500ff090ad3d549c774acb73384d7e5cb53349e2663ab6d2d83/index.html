&gt;THE END OF NATIONAL MARKETS (Electronic cash makes regulation difficult)

&gt;
&gt;----------------------------
&gt;
&gt;Twenty-six years ago, Raymond Vernon's "Sovereignty at Bay" proclaimed
&gt;that "concepts such as national sovereignty and national economic
&gt;strength appear curiously drained of meaning."
&gt;
&gt;Other books followed, arguing that sovereignty, the nation-state, and
&gt;the national economy were finished -- victims of multinational
&gt;enterprises and the internationalization of production. While
&gt;sovereign states and national markets have outlasted the chorus of
&gt;Cassandras, this time the sky really may be falling. The emergence of
&gt;electronic cash and a digitally networked global economy pose direct
&gt;threats to the very basis of the territorial state.
&gt;
&gt;Let us begin with two vignettes. Fact: Smugglers fly Boeing 747s
&gt;loaded with illicit drugs into Mexico and then cram the jumbo jets
&gt;full of cash -- American bills -- for the return trip. Fiction: Uncle
&gt;Enzo, Mafia CEO, pays for intelligence in the digital future of Neal
&gt;Stephenson's novel Snow Crash: "He reaches into his pocket and pulls
&gt;out a hypercard and hands it toward Hiro. It says 'Twenty-Five Million
&gt;Hong Kong Dollars.' Hiro reaches out and takes the card. Somewhere on
&gt;earth, two computers swap bursts of electronic noise and the money
&gt;gets transferred from the Mafia's account to Hiro's."
&gt;
&gt;The 747s leaving Mexico are anachronisms, among the last surviving
&gt;examples of the physical transfer of large amounts of currency across
&gt;national borders. Most money has been electronic for some time.
&gt;Virtually all of the trillions of dollars, marks, and yen that make
&gt;their way around the world each day take the form of bytes -- chains
&gt;of zeros and ones. Only at the very end of its journey is money
&gt;transformed into something tangible: credit cards, checks, cash, or
&gt;coins.
&gt;
&gt;Hypercards are here. Mondex, a smart card or electronic purse, can be
&gt;"loaded" with electronic money from an automatic teller machine (atm)
&gt;or by telephone or personal computer using a card-reading device.
&gt;Money is spent either by swiping the card through a retailer's
&gt;terminal or over the Internet by using the card reader and a personal
&gt;computer. An electronic wallet allows anonymous card-to-card
&gt;transfers.
&gt;
&gt;It is not just the current technology of electronic cash (e-cash) or
&gt;even what might be technologically feasible in the future that
&gt;presents policymakers with new challenges. Rather, policymakers must
&gt;confront directly the implications of this technology -- and, more
&gt;generally, the emergence of an electronically networked global economy
&gt;-- for economic and political governance. As the U.S. comptroller of
&gt;the currency, Eugene Ludwig, has noted, "There is clearly a freight
&gt;train coming down the tracks...Just because it hasn't arrived yet
&gt;doesn't mean we shouldn't start getting ready."
&gt;
&gt;ELECTRONIC MONEY
&gt;
&gt;Many different forms of "electronic money" are under development, but
&gt;it is useful to look at three general categories: electronic debit and
&gt;credit systems; various forms of smart cards; and true digital money,
&gt;which has many of the properties of cash.
&gt;
&gt;Electronic debit and credit systems already exist. When a consumer
&gt;uses an ATM card to pay for merchandise, funds are transferred from
&gt;his or her account to the merchant's. Credit cards are used to make
&gt;payments over the Internet. Computer software such as Intuit provides
&gt;electronic bill payment, and it is but a short step to true electronic
&gt;checks --authenticated by a digital signature -- that can be
&gt;transmitted to the payee, endorsed, and deposited over the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;Electronic debit and credit systems represent new, more convenient
&gt;means of payment, but not new payment systems. A traditional bank or
&gt;credit card transaction lies at the end of every transaction chain.
&gt;Smart cards and digital money represent new payment systems with
&gt;potentially revolutionary implications. Smart cards are plastic
&gt;"credit" cards with an embedded microchip. Many are now used as
&gt;telephone or transit payment devices. They can be loaded with currency
&gt;from an atm or via a card reader from a telephone or personal
&gt;computer, which can then be spent at businesses, vending machines, or
&gt;turnstiles that have been equipped with appropriate devices. At this
&gt;most basic level, a smart card is simply a debit card that does not
&gt;require bank approval for each transaction; clearance takes place each
&gt;day and the value resides in third-party accounts. There is no reason,
&gt;however, that smart cards have to be limited in this way.
&gt;
&gt;Banks or other institutions could provide value on smart cards through
&gt;loans, payments for services, or products. The immediate transfer of
&gt;funds between bank accounts is not necessary; units of value can
&gt;circulate from card to card -- and from user to user -- without
&gt;debiting or crediting third-party accounts. Assuming confidence in the
&gt;creating institution, "money" could be created on smart cards and
&gt;could circulate almost indefinitely before redemption.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, electronic money can take true digital form, existing as
&gt;units of value in the form of bytes stored in the memory of personal
&gt;computers that may or may not be backed up by reserve accounts of real
&gt;money. The money could be downloaded from an account, supplied as a
&gt;loan or as payment, or bought with a credit card over the Internet. As
&gt;long as digital cash can be authenticated and there is confidence in
&gt;its continued acceptance, it could circulate indefinitely, allowing
&gt;peer-to-peer payments at will. These are big "ifs," but they are well
&gt;within the realm of the possible.
&gt;
&gt;Imagine a world where true e-cash is an everyday reality. Whether all
&gt;of the following assumptions are correct or even immediately feasible
&gt;is unimportant; some form of e-cash is coming, and we need to begin
&gt;the process of thinking about its as-yet-unexplored consequences for
&gt;economic and political governance.
&gt;
&gt;The year is 2005. You have a number of brands of e-cash on your
&gt;computer's hard drive: some withdrawn from a bank in Antigua, some
&gt;borrowed from Microsoft, and some earned as payment for your services.
&gt;You use the digital value units (DVUs) to purchase information from a
&gt;Web site, pay bills, or send money to your daughter in graduate
&gt;school. Peer-to-peer payments are easy: You can transfer DVUs to any
&gt;computer anyplace in the world with a few keystrokes.
&gt;
&gt;Your e-cash is secure and can be authenticated easily. It is also
&gt;anonymous; governments have not been able to mandate a technology that
&gt;leaves a clear audit trail. Public-key encryption technology and
&gt;digital signatures allow blind transactions; the receiving computer
&gt;knows that the DVUs are authentic without knowing the identity of the
&gt;payer. Your e-cash can be exchanged any number of times without
&gt;leaving a trace of where it has been. It is virtually impossible to
&gt;alter the value of your e-cash at either end of the transaction (by
&gt;adding a few more zeros to it, for example).
&gt;
&gt;DVUs are almost infinitely divisible. Given the virtually negligible
&gt;transaction cost, it is efficient for you to pay a dollar or two to
&gt;see a financial report over the Internet or for your teenager to rent
&gt;a popular song for the few minutes during which it is in vogue.
&gt;Microtransactions have become the norm. E-cash is issued -- actually
&gt;created -- by a large number of institutions, bank and nonbank.
&gt;Electronic currencies (e-currencies) have begun to exist on their own;
&gt;many are no longer backed by hard currency and have developed value
&gt;separately from currencies issued by central banks. DVUs circulate for
&gt;long periods of time without being redeemed or deposited. Consumer
&gt;confidence in the issuer is crucial; as with electronic commerce
&gt;(e-commerce) in general, brand names have become critical.
&gt;
&gt;The early 21st century is described as a world of competing
&gt;e-currencies, a throwback to the 19th-century world of private
&gt;currencies. The better known brands of e-cash are highly liquid and
&gt;universally accepted. It is a relatively simple matter for you to set
&gt;up filters in your electronic purse to screen out e-currencies that
&gt;you do not want to accept.
&gt;
&gt;GOVERNANCE IN THE DIGITAL WORLD
&gt;
&gt;E-cash and the increasing importance of digital markets pose problems
&gt;for central government control over the economy and the behavior of
&gt;economic actors; they also render borders around national markets and
&gt;nation-states increasingly permeable -- or, perhaps, increasingly
&gt;irrelevant. In a world where true e-cash is an everyday reality, the
&gt;basic role of government in a liberal market economy and the relevance
&gt;of borders and geography will be drastically redefined.
&gt;
&gt;While at first glance this concern appears to reflect a traditional
&gt;break between domestic and international economic issues, in fact the
&gt;advent of e-cash raises serious questions about the very idea of
&gt;"domestic" and "international" as meaningful and distinct concepts.
&gt;The new digital world presents a number of governance issues,
&gt;described below.
&gt;
&gt;-- Can central banks control the rate of growth and the size of the
&gt;money supply? Private e-currencies will make it difficult for central
&gt;bankers to control -- or even measure or define -- monetary
&gt;aggregates. Several forms of money, issued by banks and nonbanks, will
&gt;circulate. Many of these monies may be beyond the regulatory reach of
&gt;the state. At the extreme, if, as some libertarians imagine, private
&gt;currencies dominate, currencies issued by central banks may no longer
&gt;matter.
&gt;
&gt;-- Will there still be official foreign exchange transactions? E-cash
&gt;will markedly lower existing barriers to the transfer of funds across
&gt;borders. Transactions that have been restricted to money-center banks
&gt;will be available to anyone with a computer. Peer-to-peer transfers of
&gt;DVUs across national borders do not amount to "official" foreign
&gt;exchange transactions. If you have $200 worth of DVUs on your computer
&gt;and buy a program from a German vendor, you will probably have to
&gt;agree on a mark-to-dollar price. However, transferring the DVUs to
&gt;Germany is not an "official" foreign exchange transaction; the DVUs
&gt;are simply revalued as marks. In fact, national currencies may lose
&gt;meaning with the development of DVUs that have a universally accepted
&gt;denomination. Without severe restrictions on individual privacy --
&gt;which are not out of the question -- governments will be hard-pressed
&gt;to track, account for, and control the flows of money across borders.
&gt;
&gt;-- Who will regulate or control financial institutions? The U.S.
&gt;Treasury is not sure whether existing regulations, which apply to both
&gt;banks and institutions that act like banks (i.e., take deposits),
&gt;would apply to all who issue (and create) e-cash. If nonfinancial
&gt;institutions do not accept the extensive regulatory controls that
&gt;banks take as the norm, can reserve or reporting requirements be
&gt;enforced? What about consumer protection in the event of the
&gt;insolvency of an issuer of e-cash, a system breakdown, or the loss of
&gt;a smart card?
&gt;
&gt;-- Will national income data still be meaningful? It will be almost
&gt;impossible to track transactions when e-cash becomes a widely used
&gt;means of payment, online deals across borders become much easier, and
&gt;many of the intermediaries that now serve as checkpoints for recording
&gt;transactions are eliminated by direct, peer-to-peer payments. The
&gt;widespread use of e-cash will render national economic data much less
&gt;meaningful. Indeed, the advent of both e-cash and e-commerce raises
&gt;fundamental questions about the national market as the basic unit of
&gt;account in the international economic system.
&gt;
&gt;-- How will taxes be collected? Tax evasion will be a serious problem
&gt;in an economy where e-cash transactions are the norm. It will be easy
&gt;to transfer large sums of money across borders, and tax havens will be
&gt;much easier to reach. Encrypted anonymous transactions will make
&gt;audits increasingly problematic. Additionally, tax reporting and
&gt;compliance relies on institutions and intermediaries. With e-cash and
&gt;direct payments, all sorts of sales taxes, value-added taxes, and
&gt;income taxes will be increasingly difficult to collect. More
&gt;fundamentally, the question of jurisdiction -- who gets to tax what --
&gt;will become increasingly problematic. Say you are in Philadelphia and
&gt;you decide to download music from a computer located outside Dublin
&gt;that is run by a firm in Frankfurt. You pay with e-cash deposited in a
&gt;Cayman Islands account. In which jurisdiction does the transaction
&gt;take place?
&gt;
&gt;-- Will e-cash and e-commerce widen the gap between the haves and the
&gt;have-nots? Participation in the global electronic economy requires
&gt;infrastructure and access to a computer. Will e-cash and e-commerce
&gt;further marginalize poorer population groups and even entire poor
&gt;countries? This widened gap between the haves and the have-nots --
&gt;those with and without access to computers -- could become
&gt;increasingly difficult to bridge.
&gt;
&gt;-- Will the loss of seigniorage be important as governments fight to
&gt;balance budgets? Seigniorage originally referred to the revenue or
&gt;profit generated due to the difference between the cost of making a
&gt;coin and its face value; it also refers to the reduction in government
&gt;interest payments when money circulates. The U.S. Treasury estimates
&gt;that traditional seigniorage amounted to $773 million in 1994 and that
&gt;the reduction in interest payments due to holdings of currency rather
&gt;than debt could be as much as $3.5 billion per year. The Bank for
&gt;International Settlements reports that the loss of seigniorage for its
&gt;11 member states will be more than $17 billion if smart cards
&gt;eliminate all bank notes under $25.
&gt;
&gt;-- Will fraud and criminal activity increase in an e-cash economy? At
&gt;the extreme -- and the issue of privacy versus the needs of law
&gt;enforcement is unresolved -- transfers of large sums of cash across
&gt;borders would be untraceable. There would be no audit trail. Digital
&gt;counterfeiters could work from anywhere in the world and spend
&gt;currency in any and all places. New financial crimes and forms of
&gt;fraud could arise that would be hard to detect, and it would be
&gt;extremely difficult to locate the perpetrators. The task of financing
&gt;illegal and criminal activity would be easier by orders of magnitude.
&gt;E-cash will lower the barriers to entry and reduce the risks of
&gt;criminal activity.
&gt;
&gt;Most of the issues raised in the recent National Research Council
&gt;report on cryptography's role in the information society apply
&gt;directly to electronic cash. Secure, easily authenticated, and
&gt;anonymous e-cash requires strong encryption technology. Anonymous
&gt;transactions, however, cannot be restricted to law-abiding citizens.
&gt;Encryption makes it as difficult for enforcement authorities to track
&gt;criminal activity as it does for criminals to penetrate legitimate
&gt;transmissions. Should privacy be complete? Or should law enforcement
&gt;authorities and national security agencies be provided access to
&gt;e-cash transactions through escrowed encryption, for example? What
&gt;about U.S. restrictions on the export of strong encryption technology?
&gt;E-cash is global cash; how can governments limit its geographic
&gt;spread? Can they even suggest that strong encryption algorithms be
&gt;restricted territorially?
&gt;
&gt;GEOGRAPHIC SPACE VERSUS CYBERSPACE
&gt;
&gt;A recent U.S. Treasury paper dealing with the tax implications of
&gt;electronic commerce argues that new communications technologies have
&gt;"effectively eliminated national borders on the information highway."
&gt;It is clear from the paper's subsequent discussion, however, that the
&gt;more fundamental problem is that electronic commerce may "dissolve the
&gt;link between an income-producing activity and a specific location."
&gt;The source of taxable income, which plays a major role in determining
&gt;liability, is defined geographically in terms of where the economic
&gt;activity that produces the income is located. Therein lies the rub:
&gt;"Electronic commerce doesn't seem to occur in any physical location
&gt;but instead takes place in the nebulous world of 'cyberspace.'" In a
&gt;digital economy it will be difficult, or even impossible, to link
&gt;income streams with specific geographic locations.
&gt;
&gt;Digitalization is cutting money and finance loose from its geographic
&gt;moorings. The framework of regulation that governs financial
&gt;institutions assumes that customers and institutions are linked by
&gt;geography -- that spatial proximity matters. E-cash and e-commerce
&gt;snap that link. What remains are systems of economic and political
&gt;governance that are rooted in geography and are trying nonetheless to
&gt;deal with e-cash and markets that exist in cyberspace. The obvious
&gt;disconnect here will only worsen over time.
&gt;
&gt;The geographical rooting of political and economic authority is
&gt;relatively recent. Territorial sovereignty, borders, and a clear
&gt;distinction between domestic and international spheres are modern
&gt;concepts associated with the rise of the nation-state. Territorial
&gt;sovereignty implies a world divided into clearly demarcated and
&gt;mutually exclusive geographic jurisdictions. It implies a world where
&gt;economic and political control arise from control over territory.
&gt;The international financial system -- which consists of hundreds of
&gt;thousands of computer screens around the globe -- is the first
&gt;international electronic marketplace. It will not be the last. E-cash
&gt;is one manifestation of a global economy that is constructed in
&gt;cyberspace rather than geographic space. The fundamental problems that
&gt;e-cash poses for governance result from this disconnect between
&gt;electronic markets and political geography.
&gt;
&gt;The very idea of controlling the money supply, for example, assumes
&gt;that geography provides a relevant means of defining the scope of the
&gt;market. It assumes that economic borders are effective, that the flow
&gt;of money across them can be monitored and controlled, and that the
&gt;volume of money within a fixed geographic area is important. All of
&gt;those assumptions are increasingly questionable in a digital world
&gt;economy.
&gt;
&gt;Many of our basic tax principles assume that transactions and income
&gt;streams can be located precisely within a given national market. That
&gt;assumption is problematic when e-cash is spent on a computer network.
&gt;It is problematic when many important economic transactions cannot be
&gt;located, or may not even take place, in geographic space.
&gt;
&gt;The increasing irrelevance of geographic jurisdiction in a digital
&gt;world economy markedly increases the risks of fraud, money-laundering,
&gt;and other financial crimes. Asking where the fraud or money-laundering
&gt;took place means asking "Whose jurisdiction applies?" and "Whose law
&gt;applies?" We need to learn to deal with crimes that cannot be located
&gt;in geographic space, where existing concepts of national jurisdiction
&gt;are increasingly irrelevant.
&gt;
&gt;The term "disintermediation" was first used to describe the
&gt;replacement of banks as financial intermediaries by direct lending in
&gt;money markets when interest rates rose. It is often used in the world
&gt;of e-commerce to describe the elimination of intermediaries by direct
&gt;seller-to-buyer transactions over the Internet. Many observers argue
&gt;that e-cash is likely to disintermediate banks. Of more fundamental
&gt;importance is the possibility that e-cash and e-commerce will
&gt;disintermediate the territorial state.
&gt;
&gt;To be clear, I argue that we face not the end of the state, but rather
&gt;the diminished efficacy of political and economic governance that is
&gt;rooted in geographic sovereignty and in mutually exclusive territorial
&gt;jurisdiction. Questions such as: "Where did the transaction take
&gt;place?" "Where did the income stream arise?" " Where is the financial
&gt;institution located?" and "Whose law applies?" will lose meaning.
&gt;E-cash and e-commerce are symptoms, albeit important ones, of an
&gt;increasing asymmetry between economics and politics, between an
&gt;electronically integrated world economy and territorial nation-states,
&gt;and between cyberspace and geographic space. How this asymmetry will
&gt;be resolved and how economic and political relations will be
&gt;reconstructed are two of the critical questions of our time.
&gt;
&gt;WHAT IS TO BE DONE?
&gt;
&gt;The question asked here is not "What is feasible?" but "What are the
&gt;limits of the possible?" Whether the picture presented here is correct
&gt;in all -- or even some -- of its details is unimportant. A digital
&gt;world economy is emerging. Imagining possible scenarios is necessary
&gt;if we are to come to grips with the consequences of this revolution.
&gt;The purpose here is to raise problems rather than to solve them and to
&gt;imagine possible futures and think about their implications for
&gt;economic and political governance. A digital world economy will demand
&gt;increasing international cooperation, harmonizing national regulations
&gt;and legislation, and strengthening the authority of international
&gt;institutions.
&gt;
&gt;The harmonization of national regulations will help to prevent
&gt;institutions, such as those issuing e-cash, from slipping between
&gt;national jurisdictions or shopping for the nation with the least
&gt;onerous regulations. However, it will not address the basic problem of
&gt;the disconnect between geographic jurisdiction and an electronically
&gt;integrated global economy.
&gt;
&gt;If it is impossible to locate transactions geographically -- if the
&gt;flows of e-cash are outside of the jurisdictional reach of every
&gt;country -- then the harmonization of national regulations will
&gt;accomplish little. The basic problem is not one of overlapping or
&gt;conflicting jurisdictions; it stems from the lack of meaning of the
&gt;very concept of "jurisdiction" in a digitalized global economy.
&gt;The erosion of the viability of territorial jurisdiction calls for
&gt;strengthened international institutions. It calls for giving
&gt;international institutions real authority to measure, to control, and,
&gt;perhaps, to tax. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision -- an
&gt;international body of bank regulators who set global standards --
&gt;could perhaps be given the authority to collect information from
&gt;financial institutions wherever they are located and formulate and
&gt;enforce regulations globally. Interpol, or its equivalent, may have to
&gt;be given jurisdiction over financial crimes, regardless of where they
&gt;are committed. That does not mean a world government; it does mean a
&gt;markedly increased level of international cooperation.
&gt;
&gt;The questions we must face are whether territorial sovereignty will
&gt;continue to be viable as the primary basis for economic and political
&gt;governance as we enter the 21st century, and what the implications
&gt;will be for the American economy -- and Americans in general -- if we
&gt;refuse to cooperate internationally in the face of an increasingly
&gt;integrated global economy.

&gt;
&gt;ELECTRONIC CASH: A GLOSSARY
&gt;
&gt;DIGITAL DATA: Information coded into a series of zeros and ones that
&gt;can be transmitted and processed electronically.
&gt;
&gt;DIGITAL SIGNATURE: A code that allows absolute authentication of the
&gt;origin and integrity of a document, check, or electronic cash that has
&gt;been sent over a computer network. A blind signature allows
&gt;authentication without revealing the identity of the sender.
&gt;
&gt;DISINTERMEDIATION: The substitution of direct transactions for those
&gt;that are mediated. The term originated when rising interest rates
&gt;caused savings to be withdrawn from banks -- whose interest rates were
&gt;capped -- and invested in money market instruments that were the
&gt;direct debts of borrowers. Banks were disintermediated. In electronic
&gt;commerce, the term refers to the rise of direct buyer-to-seller
&gt;relationships over the Internet, disintermediating wholesalers and
&gt;retail outlets.
&gt;
&gt;ELECTRONIC MONEY: Units or tokens of monetary value that take digital
&gt;form and are transmitted over electronic networks. Digital Value Units
&gt;are the basic units of denomination of electronic money; they may or
&gt;may not correspond to units of national currency.
&gt;
&gt;ENCRYPTION: The coding of information for security purposes, such as
&gt;credit card numbers or electronic cash used over the Internet.
&gt;Public-key encryption uses a mathematical algorithm comprising a pair
&gt;of strings of numbers to encrypt and decrypt the data. For example,
&gt;the sender would encrypt the data with the receiver's public key and
&gt;the receiver would decrypt with his or her private key.
&gt;
&gt;INTERNET: A global network of linked networks that allows
&gt;communication and the sharing of information among many different
&gt;types of computers. The World Wide Web is a graphical system on the
&gt;Internet that allows rapid movement between documents and computers
&gt;through the use of embedded (hypertext) links.
&gt;
&gt;SMART CARDS: A plastic card, similar to a credit card, containing a
&gt;microchip that can be used to retrieve, store, process, and transmit
&gt;digital data like electronic cash or medical information.
