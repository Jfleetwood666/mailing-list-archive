We Have Over 150 Private Foundations In Our Program
All Over the United States...

WE ARE A FINANCIAL FINDER &amp; MATCHING SERVICE
.."INTEREST - FREE CASH GRANTS!! - NEVER PAY BACK!!!"...


FOUNDATIONS CAN BE A BETTER SOURCE FOR FINANCE, THAN BANKS!
___________________________________________________________
Foundations give away billions of dollars every year to individuals. 
Most are non-profit organizations dedicated to the betterment of
society.  A foundation is excempt  from income tax because it's
non-profit status.  Private foundations have been giving out
cash-grants to people for over 100 years.  You can check with your
attorney or local chamber of commerce.

ARE YOU BEING REJECTED FOR THE MONEY YOU NEED SO BADLY?
_________________________________________________________
Then Why Not Try A Private Foundation? Interest Free Cash Grants From
$500.00 &amp; Up to $50,000.00. No Collateral.  No Cosigners, No Security
Deposit, No Mortgages. No Credit Check.  No Pay Back.

ANYONE CAN GET AN INTEREST FREE CASH GRANT!
____________________________________________
As long as they have a genuine reason for needing money, &amp; as long as
the foundation guidelines are met.

Dear Applicant,

This letter tells you HOW YOU CAN GET AN INTEREST-FREE CASH GRANT. 
Take a few minutes to read it. You'll be suprised  to see how easy it
is to get a Cash-Grant, by mail. From time to time, everyone needs to
borrow.  The problem is that for most people making a loan is a big
hassle. Going to banks or finance companies in person takes a lot of
time.  In most cases, thereis endless paperwork.  And Unfortunately,
in many cases all that you end up with is a rejection notice.


ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIT CHECK
________________________
People are getting CASH GRANTS BY MAIL, that are Interest -Free &amp; do
not have to be paid back, in any way.  Getting a Grant by mail is
probably a lot easier than you think.  In your area, there are usually
only a small number of places that will provide you with the money,
that you need.  On the other hand, there are literally hundreds of
private foundations who are anxious to donate money by mail, to people
who have genuine reasons for needing the money.  While it is not
possible for anyone to guarantee that you will receive a CASH GRANT BY
MAIL, the fact is that right now, someone just like you is getting
your grant.

Chances are that most banks in your area have very stringent loan
requirements.  On the other hand, most foundations who give GRANTS BY
MAIL are much more lenient.  Persons who have poor credit, no credit
or even those who have gone through bankruptcy  are able to get the
money that they need BY MAIL sent to them by check payable to them,
because foundations are NOT interested in CREDIT RATINGS.

GETTING A GRANT BY MAIL IS CONFIDENTIAL
____________________________________
There are no embarrassing interviews.  Neither collateral nor
cosigners are required.  The main requirement is that you have a
legitimate need for the money and are willing to use it for whatever
reason that the foundation agrees to.  Everything is handled by mail.

We are not associated with any of the foundations in our program,
therefore all money will go directly to you, payable to you.  As a
Financial Finder &amp; Matching Service, we know where the money is and
which private foundations may be most likely to approver your grant. 
There are actually hundreds of foundations with money that they are
anxious to donate.  It is our job to put you in touch with them.

PLEASE REMEMBER: CASH-GRANTS are FREE of any interest, 
&amp; they DO NOT NEED TO BE PAID BACK!
________________________________________________
Foundations give out money for a wide variety of needs as long as it
is something LEGAL &amp; this means that you obtain the money to pay off
old bills, go on vacation, meet emergency needs or to buy anything
that you might need, as long as the foundation agrees to it. 
Everything is handled by mail.


YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU WANT TO OBTAIN.  
________________________________________________
The amount can be as little as $500.00 and up to $50,000.00, possible.
 And remember, there is NO CREDIT CHECK.

Interest-Free Cash Grants are ideal for people who have bad credit or
bankruptcy.  If you had trouble in the past dealing with banks, then
these private foundations, are a better source for finances, because
they don't care about bad credit or bankruptcies.  (Foundations do not
do a  credit check on a client..)

As a Financial Finder &amp; Matching Service, we'll review your service
application form and determine which foundations may be most likely to
provide you with the money that you need.  Keep in mind that we have
only reputable foundations in our program.  You are protected by the
fact that these foundations are regulated by the laws of the United
States.

No matter how much you want to obtain, no matter what you want to use
the money for-we feel confident that we can help you to get it!  With
the service we are offering you.

WE GUARANTEE THAT UNLESS WE HELP YOU WITH OUR SERVICE, TO GET THE
MONEY THAT YOU NEED, OUR APPLICATION FEE OF $19.95 WILL BE REFUNDED!
