&gt;Subject: Social Democrats Sterilize the Inferior
&gt;
&gt;Surprisingly, the revelations about 40 years of forced sterilizations by the
&gt;Social Democratic governments in Sweden generated only small stories in the
&gt;New York Times and the Washington Post.  I'm sure they would have been
&gt;equally uninterested in revelations about forced sterilization in, say,
&gt;Thatcher's Britain.  Be sure to read to the last line of the story where at
&gt;last the AP pins it directly on the Social Democrats' ideas.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;By JIM HEINTZ
&gt;.c The Associated Press
&gt;
&gt;STOCKHOLM, Sweden (Aug. 25) - They were found to be ''inferior,'' flawed by
&gt;bad eyesight, mental retardation or ''undesirable'' racial characteristics.
&gt;To prevent this genetic heritage from being passed on, they were sterilized -
&gt;sometimes involuntarily.
&gt;
&gt;Sweden had as many as 60,000 of its own citizens sterilized between 1935 and
&gt;1976. Adults and children were singled out by doctors, school authorities or
&gt;other officials and were pressured to consent to the procedures.
&gt;
&gt;This sterilization program bore chilling similarities to Nazi ideas of racial
&gt;superiority - and media reports on it now are provoking sober
&gt;self-examination.
&gt;
&gt;The program stemmed from the pursuit of eugenics, a once-popular movement to
&gt;improve humanity by controlling genetic factors in reproduction.
&gt;
&gt;Though Sweden's sterilization program was a matter of record, it received
&gt;little public attention, ignored in schoolbooks and hardly mentioned in
&gt;reference works. A recent series by the prestigious newspaper Dagens Nyheter,
&gt;however, has stirred national debate.
&gt;
&gt;Especially shocking to many Swedes is the fact that the law allowing the
&gt;sterilizations wasn't overturned until 1976, three decades after the Nazis'
&gt;human engineering policies collapsed in the rubble of the Third Reich.
&gt;
&gt;The sterilizations targeted a wide range of people: those of mixed race;
&gt;unmarried mothers with several children; people judged to be habitual
&gt;criminals; even a boy considered ''sexually precocious.''
&gt;
&gt;''Grounds for recommending sterilization: unmistakable Gypsy features,
&gt;psychopathy, vagabond life,'' reads one document cited by Dagens Nyheter.
&gt;
&gt;Maria Nordin, 72, told the newspaper she had been sterilized in 1943 because
&gt;she was regarded as mentally inferior.
&gt;
&gt;''One day, the (school) superintendent said I should come into his room to
&gt;sign some papers. I understood what this was about so I ran into a toilet and
&gt;sat there and cried for a long time for myself,'' she said.
&gt;
&gt;Sweden, with its well-developed welfare state and long-standing progressive
&gt;stances on social issues, is not accustomed to being on the defensive on
&gt;ethical issues.
&gt;
&gt;''This is a frightening picture that now is being shown to the Swedish
&gt;people,'' Alf Svensson, chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic
&gt;Party, said in a letter to Prime Minister Goeran Persson.
&gt;
&gt;Social Minister Margot Wallstroem says she is considering whether to
&gt;compensate people who were forcibly sterilized. That would require
&gt;overturning current law that says the victims can't get compensation because
&gt;the sterilizations were lawful when performed.
&gt;
&gt;Nordin applied for compensation last year but her request was turned down by
&gt;Wallstroem, who now says she feels ashamed over the matter.
&gt;
&gt;''I will take up the matter for discussion with the government. It is the
&gt;least I can do,'' the Cabinet minister said.
&gt;
&gt;The Dagens Nyheter report has hit Swedes at a time when they were already
&gt;examining some painful history from World War II. The government, under
&gt;increasing international pressure, is looking into whether property looted by
&gt;the Nazis from Jews in other countries ended up in Sweden.
&gt;
&gt;The issue of forced sterilization stands to be even more troublesome, because
&gt;it was conducted under the ostensibly benign gaze of the Social Democrats -
&gt;that party that built Sweden's welfare state and proclaimed it a paragon of
&gt;enlightened government.
&gt;
&gt;''The Social Democrats are implicated in a collective guilt,'' said Social
&gt;Minister Wallstroem, herself a member of the party.
&gt;
&gt;The sterilization programs can be traced to turn-of-the-century enthusiasm
&gt;for eugenics.
&gt;
&gt;The movement had adherents in many countries, but ''Sweden was the first in
&gt;the world to grant this pseudoscience official recognition,'' Dagens Nyheter
&gt;wrote in describing how Sweden established an Institute of Racial Biology in
&gt;1921.
&gt;
&gt;Not only did eugenics foresee an improved human race, it also was appealing
&gt;to Social Democrats, who were beginning to see that Sweden's welfare state
&gt;would be costly and wanted to limit the number of people who would have to be
&gt;supported, the newspaper said.
