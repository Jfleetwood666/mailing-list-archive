Dear Internet Friend,

I couldn't resist this one.  Hey what could be
easier and for such a great cause.  It's only
$5 bucks and really nothing to it !! My $5 is
already in the mail. Don't wait to read this !!
It's short to read, easy to do, and MONEY in
your mail box PRONTO !!!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;


 
THIS IS THE FAST ONE WHILE YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE 
OTHERS TO WORK.  YOU CAN HAVE $7,000 IN TWO WEEKS 
WITH ONLY $5 TOTAL COST, AND ONE HOUR OF YOUR TIME.
 
If you want to make a few thousand dollars really 
quickly, then please take a moment to read and 
understand this fast program I am sharing with you.
 
No, it is NOT what you think.
 
YOU DO NOT have to send $5.00 to five people 
to buy a report, recipe or get on their mailing list.
Nor will you need to invest more money later to get
things going. 

THIS IS THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM you will ever 
be able to do. 
Complete it in ONE HOUR and you will never forget 
the day you first received it.  If you are doing 
other programs, by all means stay with them.

The more the merrier. But, PLEASE READ ON!
 
First of all, there are only THREE LEVELS, not four,
five or six like many other programs.
This three-level program is more realistic and much,
much faster. Because it is so easy, the response
rate for this program is VERY HIGH and VERY FAST, 
and you receive your reward in about FOURTEEN DAYS.
That's only TWO WEEKS ~ not three months.
Just in time to pay next months bills!
 
TRUE STORY
 
Cindy Allen tells how she ran this program four 
times last year. The first  time, she received
$3,000 in cash in two weeks, and then $7,000 in cash
the next three times. When this MLM is continued as
it should be, EVERYONE PROFITS!!!  Don't be afraid
to make gifts to strangers: they will come back
to you ten fold. All of us have uses for our
hard-earned money, but most of us have very little
left after we pay the bills. THIS CAN DO IT FOR YOU!!!! 
 
HERE ARE THE DETAILS
 
You only send 25 copies (not 200 or more as in
other programs). You should send them to PEOPLE WHO
SEND YOU THEIR PROGRAM, because they are already
believers, and your program is BETTER AND FASTER.
Even if you are already in a program, continue,
stay with it, but do yourself a favor and 

DO THIS ONE as well.  RIGHT NOW!!! 

It is simple and takes a very small investment, not
hundreds of dollars. It will pay you before your
other programs begin to trickle in!!!!
 
JUST GIVE ONE PERSON $5.00. That's it! That's all!
Follow the simple instructions, and in TWO WEEKS,
you can have at least $7,000 because most
PEOPLE WILL RESPOND due to the LOW INVESTMENT, 
SPEED and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL. We are not even
figuring a 50% response rate! That would be a
$10,000 return. REALLY!  So let's all keep it going,
and help each other in these tough times.
 
1.  On a blank sheet of paper, write down 
    "DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU"
    " HERE IS YOUR GIFT"
     clearly and fold it around a FIVE DOLLAR BILL. Send
     this to the FIRST NAME on the list.
     ONLY THE FIRST PERSON ON THE LIST GETS YOUR
     FIVE DOLLAR GIFT.
 
2.  Remove the FIRST (#1) name from the list.  
     Move the other two names up and add YOUR NAME
     to the list in the third (#3) position.
 
3.   Now Email this letter with your name in the
     third position on it to 20 people or more
     who Email your their programs!  
     Send it to your friends on the net but 
     do it right away. It's so easy. 
     Don't mull it over. ONE HOUR. THAT'S IT!
 
THERE IS NO MORE TO DO. When your name reaches 
the first position in a few  hours (!), 
it will be your turn to collect your gifts.  
The gifts will be sent to you by over 1500 
to 2000 people like yourself who are willing to
invest $5.00 and an hour to receive $7,000 in cash.
Your entire investment is the $5.00 you sent to 
name #1.  That's all!!  There could be $7,000 in
$5.00 bills in your mailbox within two weeks.
CONSIDER THAT!!!!!
 
CAN I DO IT AGAIN?    OF COURSE......
 
Some people may want only to send this letter 
to friends in their news groups while others 
may choose to reply to all Internet offers 
via e-mail with THIS LETTER.  
That's fine: you can if you want.  
THINK ABOUT THAT!!!  The sky really is the limit
with this unique "GIFTING CLUB"! 50%!
 
Not interested?  C'mon!  Isn't the prospect of
an easy $7,000 to $10,000 in
TWO WEEKS worth alittle experimentation?  
One hour of your time and $5.00.
Hmmmm!!!
 
ACT FAST AND GET MONEY FAST!!!!!
 
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY MAKE THIS PLAN WORK. 
COPY THE NAMES CAREFULLY AND SEND $5.00 
TO THE FIRST NAME TODAY.
 
DO UNTO OTHERS, AS YOU WOULD HAVE OTHERS DO UNTO YOU.
PEOPLE HELPING OTHER PEOPLE.
