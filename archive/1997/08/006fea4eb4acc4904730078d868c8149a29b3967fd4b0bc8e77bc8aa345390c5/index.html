	Personally, I have to say that if *I* got a reply to an
	anonymous post before it had even reached its destination,
	I would start to worry...

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are there any Cypherpunks mailing list members who can confirm that
&gt; &gt; there was a series of posts related to Princess Diana's death in the
&gt; &gt; days before the event? I am particularly interested in information as
&gt; &gt; to whether Cypherpunks were in any way responsible for a slight delay
&gt; &gt; in the timing of her death.
&gt; &gt; I am particularly interested in communicating with the person who sent
&gt; &gt; me the anonymous messages between 8/24/97 and 8/30/97 using the nym
&gt; &gt; "A'Tak A'Tdorn'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you have information and an interest in sharing it, please send a
&gt; &gt; post to the Cypherpunks list or the fight-censorship list, indicating
&gt; &gt; such. If you wish for me to contact you through a neutral, third party,
&gt; &gt; indicate that as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank You
&gt; 
&gt;  If you have a death-wish, then send this message again through the
&gt; Canadian Mountie remailer.  {:&gt;)-----&lt;
&gt; {HELP! They knocked me down and cut off my arms!}
&gt; 
&gt;  I presume the message you are referring to on 24/8/97 is the one
&gt; which answers your previous anonymous inquiry by saying,
&gt;  "Only for the moment we are saying nothing."
&gt;  It meant what it said. However, since the moment is over I suppose
&gt; there is no harm in saying "something."  I will therefore give you
&gt; a modicum of information on the messages which have passed through
&gt; the cypherpunks list since your original notification that something
&gt; was in the wind.
&gt;   For starters, although I have not seen the original email which you
&gt; received but I believe that if you read it closely you will see that
&gt; it implied that the coming messages to the list would be in a form
&gt; which was _analogous_ to the event, whereas you seemed to take it
&gt; literally as a plan to "Nuke D.C."
&gt; [How you managed to come to the conclusion that spooks and shadows
&gt; would refer to a coming event directly totally escapes me!?!]
&gt;  If you will reinterpret the posts in question in light of the event,
&gt; I believe you will see the thread that winds through them.
&gt; 
&gt;  As you were told, the AOL'er messages were used as markers to divine
&gt; which of the coming messages contained stegonographic messages of one
&gt; sort or another, or pointers to graphics containing the stegonography.
&gt; I am assuming you understood this and sent the AOL'er message saying,
&gt; "Please send more details...thanks"
&gt; 
&gt;  If you had not taken the phrase "Nuke D.C." so literally you would
&gt; have noticed that the "Fade to Gray" post linked the coming major
&gt; event (Nuke D.C.) to foreigners, automobiles and death.
&gt;  You were not alone in your request for details regarding the message
&gt; in the Quote of the day:
&gt;         "I know the day it happens. On August 29, 1997 it's going
&gt;          to feel pretty fucking real to you too."
&gt; which had been sent by one of the Canadians involved in ferreting out
&gt; the details of the coming event.
&gt;  One of the cypherpunk list members posted the question, "When is X-Day
&gt; supposed to be?" when there was no mention of 'X-Day' in the quote. This
&gt; understandably led to postponement of the event while those involved
&gt; checked to see if there had been a breach in their security.
&gt;   The subsequent message which stated, "I don't know what you mean by
&gt; 'When is X-Day supposed to be?'" was interpreted by those involved to
&gt; indicate that full details of their plans remained a mystery to those
&gt; who were trying to expose and stop it.
&gt;   After they had put things in motion to proceed with their backup plan,
&gt; however, two more messages came to the list which indicated that there
&gt; was more known about their plan than they had suspected.
&gt; 
&gt;  In reply to the post expressing lack of knowledge about the timing of
&gt; X-Day, a post from _lne.com_ (surprise, surprise) suggested that X-Day
&gt; referred to people who are going to be "taken from the earth" (death)
&gt; by "pleasure saucers" (limosene) and noting that the limosene would
&gt; be operated by "Greys" (a reference to the &lt;fade to grey&gt; ending of
&gt; the "Fade To Gray" post--indicating a spook/LEA connection). The post
&gt; ended by suggesting the time of the event might be "April" (4 o'clock)
&gt; and gave a pointer to a sight with a graphic stego which would provide
&gt; a visual message.
&gt; 
&gt;  The second post that came well after it had been decided to proceed
&gt; with the backup plan said,
&gt;         "The metallic custard scent ripped through the
&gt;          stegosaurus' nostrils."
&gt;         (metallic custard being a car bomb--note eye witness
&gt;          accounts by Michael Solomon {who just happened to be
&gt;          on the scene, naturally} speaking of a "loud explosion"
&gt;          that brought to mind "terrorists."}
&gt; 
&gt;         "Clearly the meonotreme (Monarchist/Anarchist/Extremist)
&gt;          journey it would begin as it had ended."
&gt;         (The Fairy Tale Princess who had embarked on an extremist
&gt;          political journey was about to return to becoming the
&gt;          {dead} Fairy Tale Princess, once again.)
&gt; 
&gt;         "The ponder-tree hung itself in the heavy air,
&gt;          it's sap becomming purple."
&gt;         (Diana had sealed her death {"hung itself"} when she
&gt;          opted to bond herself to Royal blood.)
&gt; 
&gt;         "And flowed enigmatically
&gt;          like a river of broken curves and powdered eggshells."
&gt;         (A reference to the immediate area of the planned event,
&gt;          which would be at the split {"broken"} of a tunnel road
&gt;          {"river"} and the airbags being sabotaged.)
&gt; 
&gt;  After this post appeared on the cypherpunks list, a Timmy C. Mayflower
&gt; ASCII art spam showed up on the list from a juno remailer, but it had
&gt; a Timothy C. May .sig following the artwork. (Followed by the proverbial
&gt; GJBuller response.)
&gt;  Then both the juno remailer and the toad list experienced problems with
&gt; multiple messages being sent to _some_ people and _not_ others, as well
&gt; as _some_ people not getting certain messages at all.
&gt;   You will also note that, as the "Fade To Gray" post indicated (re: all
&gt; the cypherpunks being "out of town" at the time of the event), there was
&gt; no activity on the list in the time surrounding the event.
&gt;   As for the information in the graphic pointed to by the lne.com post,
&gt; it was never considered to be anything but an attempt at intentional
&gt; misdirection.
&gt; 
&gt;  You were told months ago that Diana's current power came from the
&gt; failure of the so-called suicide attempt and that the agreement to
&gt; leave her free to continue her public activities was contingent upon
&gt; her remaing free from political matters. You were also informed that
&gt; her involvement with the Labor Party land-mine issue was a breach of
&gt; that agreement, as was her June 13th reference to the resistance of
&gt; the Conservative party in this regard.
&gt;  When you were contacted last week, you should have been able to figure
&gt; out for yourself what her link to the Harrods clan indicated. You were
&gt; made aware of everything you needed to be sitting on top of the story.
&gt;  Given the fact that you have shown so little ability to act on the
&gt; information you have already been given, we are probably wasting our
&gt; time by giving you any further information. Regardless, if you wish to
&gt; pursue the matter then I suggest that you research:
&gt;         a) the explosion
&gt;         b) the driver's airbag
&gt;         c) the liquid on the ground at the scene
&gt;         d) the source of changes in the day's schedule
&gt;          and/or the previous day's schedule
&gt;         e) the details of who was involved in the arrest
&gt;          {debriefing} of the photographers present
&gt; 
&gt;  If you _do_ manage to follow up on the information then we _might_ be
&gt; inclined to give you the details of Prince Charle's upcoming wedding
&gt; and coronation.
