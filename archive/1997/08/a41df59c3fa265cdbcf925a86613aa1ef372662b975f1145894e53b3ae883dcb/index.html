Dear Friend:

NOW, AN EXCITING MLM OPPORTUNITY IS HERE...MUTUAL FUND$ &amp; BABY
BOOMER$ - A PERFECT MLM MARRIAGE!!!

The bull market of the past 15 years is still roaring on with stocks
proving again why they are historically the premier investment choice of
savvy investors. Mutual Funds are the vehicles to invest in with
diversified investment risk for the underlying individual stocks which
have been on a steady climb upward since the early '80s. 

                                      FACTS ON MUTUAL FUNDS

- Mutual Funds manage about $2.8 Trillion

- 31% of U.S. households invest in Mutual Funds

- There are over 5,500 different Mutual Funds

                                     BENEFITS OF MUTUAL FUNDS

- LOWER INVESTOR RISK - due to diversification of portfolios by buying
many different securities.

- EASY ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY - Mutual Funds mean LIQUIDITY, i.e. you can
buy &amp; sell your investment shares on any business day.

- PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT - skilled &amp; experienced investment
professionals invest your money by tracking markets &amp; trends to identify
opportunities. This allows investors to minimize their monitoring &amp;
follow-up.

- NO LOAD/LOW LOAD FEE - Mutual Funds have either no broker's fees or
very low fees which are very attractive  especially with frequent
transactions.

- BEAUTY OF COMPOUNDING - e.g. a 15% return over 5 years then investors
get their principal investment back with the beauty of compounding on
reinvested dividends.

                            TARGET MARKET - BABY BOOMERS

The most powerful block of consumers are the baby boomers (those born 
between 1946-64 with current age range of 33-51). The
sheer power and financial clout of this group cannot be overstated!
Boomers are dictating changes in technology, consumer products, style
preferences, tastes, etc.  All across the spectrum in the U.S. Madison
Avenue has known this for years and has exploited it in exponential
fashion. Television advertisers and direct mail catalogue companies
recognize the power of this group. Ever notice how the models and actors
are starting to look a little older, a bit grayer? Ever notice how aging
rock and roll stars such as Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Tina
Turner, Bonnie Raitt, etc. are still wildly popular? Why? Because the
group that grew up with these stars has such huge clout in the
marketplace - The Baby Boomers!

Aging Boomers are the primary target for investments such as Mutual
Funds because they have the "need" for investments as they age and the
"discretionary income" to make these investments. The strong need for
Mutual Funds is driven by other factors as well: the sudden collective
realization by this voracious group of consumer products purchasers and
credit card users that there "are" financial limits (even for them) and
that now is the time to exercise financial prudence and discipline. With
the long-term viability of Social Security in doubt, retirement concerns
are starting to mount. This is especially acute with the continual
increases in life expectancy for both sexes. College education costs for
their kids are a big concern as well.

The vast majority of Boomers are computer owners and they are a
significant percentage of online subscribers. They have the need for
Mutual Fund investments, the discretionary income and now the newfound
desire to invest in their futures.

The TIMING COULDN'T BE BETTER FOR THIS MLM OPPORTUNITY!!!
Mutual Funds and Baby Boomers are now, and will continue to be, joined
at the hip right through the Millennium and beyond!

                                   HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED?

We will provide you with four (4) reports that will help the investor
get ready for his/her Mutual Funds investments by setting financial goals,
tips to help manage debt, analyze spending habits, patterns (1st Report).

The second Report will help explain Mutual Funds with emphasis on
professional management, portfolio diversification, etc.

The third Report will look at investment needs and goals and help lead
the investor to the proper investment choice at this stage of his/her
life.

Finally, the fourth Report will provide useful tips and information on
Asset Allocation and determining what mix of funds are best suited
for your financial needs and goals.

These Reports cost $5.00 each. Your total investment is $20.00 with a
vast market of baby boomers to target. This is a fresh program being
marketed on the Internet. It has vast potential because of the size of
the target group, the group's "deep pockets" plus the investment and
long-term security needs of the target group. Your marketing letter can
combine the advantages of Mutual Funds as an investment vehicle with the
benefits and needs of the target group. The four (4) Reports are
educational, informative and an excellent first step to a cohesive,
disciplined and systematic investment program.




                                               INSTRUCTIONS

STEP 1- ORDER all four REPORTS listed by Name and Number.  For each 
Report, send $5.00 CASH and a self-addressed stamped envelope to the 
person listed with the Report. You will need all 4 Reports because you
will be Reprinting and Reselling them.  International orders should be sent
with $6.00 CASH.  ($1.00 is for the extra postage).

STEP 2 - Replace the Name &amp; Number under Report number 1 with yours, 
moving the one that was there down to Report # 2.  Name &amp; Address for #2 
is moved to Report # 3 and name &amp; address of #3 is moved to Report # 4. 
The # and address of #4 is then dropped from the list.

STEP 3 - Email a copy of the entire program to Anyone &amp; Everyone.
You can get email addresses from companies on the Internet for 
very reasonable prices.
