A member of the Cypherpunks list, who sometimes contributes articles to the
list, engaged several of us in a discussion of some topics. He requested
that we respect his desire not to have his opinions published, which I am
honoring.

However, some interesting topics were raised, and I spent a couple of hours
responding. Rather than letting the points drop into the black hole of such
sublists, I will post my responses here, editing out all references to his
identity.

Things would be so much easier if he'd just post his views to the list. I
surmise that his reasons for not posting have less to do with not wanting
to be associated with my views, as if that is possible in a free society,
and more to do with paranoia about what his employer will think.

This is my article:

&gt;Date: Mon, 2 Jun 1997 10:03:56 -0700
&gt;To: xxxx
&gt;Subject: Re: May's Banal Rant
&gt;Cc: xxxx

(He commented that I am marginalizing myself and my compatriots by my angry
views. I replied:)


&gt;The list was just as "intense" in 1993, for example. Any reading of the
&gt;traffic after the Waco incident in April of that year will show this
&gt;clearly. And 1994 was also intense, what with the heated discussion of
&gt;anonymous assassination contracts, use of crypto by some associates in
&gt;White Aryan Resistance and other politically incorrect groups, and so on.
&gt;
&gt;(There was even Froomkin-described "cannibalism" that year, as the list
&gt;_exploded_ in condemnation of Jerry Berman's EFF-led sellout on the
&gt;Wiretap Bill (aka Digital Telephony, aka CALEA, etc.). In fact, this
&gt;"cannibalism" was practiced by nearly everyone outside the specific axis
&gt;which made the Grand Compromise. It is widely believed that this event led
&gt;to the flight from D.C. of EFF and its current marginal status as a mover
&gt;and shaker. (Other reasons, too, I've heard from those who were present.
&gt;I'm not claiming to be "ahead of the curve," to use Marc's
&gt;characterization, on this one. He was there, I was not. But clearly the
&gt;support of DT/CALEA had a major, traumatizing effect on EFF. )
&gt;

(He predicts that "moderate" list members will leave the list because of my
articles. He says he stopped posting months ago because he saw the general
trend getting worse. )



&gt;I hadn't seen essays from you in a long time, xxxxx, nor from yyyyy. It
&gt;seems that a lot of folks have "been there, done that" on writing essays,
&gt;regardless of their ideological points of view. Even Detweiler writes very
&gt;few essays.
&gt;
&gt;Many of the former active contributors are now with crypto companies or
&gt;Internet companies in one form or another. Hal Finney is with PGP, a bunch
&gt;of folks (Barnes, Parekh, Green, Sandfort...) are with C2, some were with
&gt;xxxxxx (as you know), and so on. A bunch of others are doing security or
&gt;crypto work at the various companies, including Netscape, Intuit,
&gt;Microsoft, Excite, Qualcomm, etc.
&gt;
&gt;(There are also reasons for them to "tone down" their rhetoric. Some of
&gt;them have sent me e-mail saying they agree with my points (or disagree, as
&gt;the case may be) but do not feel comfortable posting publically, given
&gt;their present employment with these companies. This is a natural
&gt;development. Go back and read the rhetoric in 1992-5 about controversial
&gt;issues....many of the essayists of even the most controversial pieces then
&gt;are now at companies and are understandably less vocal. So?)
&gt;
&gt;Plus there have been the usual spin-off lists. Lewis McCarthy decided, I
&gt;presume, that he had internalized the political message of Cypherpunks and
&gt;wanted only a C and C++ forum, so he created "coderpunks." Perry Metzger,
&gt;certainly no stranger to libertarian ranting, decided apparently that he
&gt;wanted to control which rants got distributed so he created "cryptography."
&gt;
&gt;This is also natural. If you don't like who is left on Cypherpunks, and
&gt;who is posting, then either leave it or post the kind of stuff you'd like
&gt;to see.
&gt;
&gt;Those who never post anymore are in a poor position to criticize others
&gt;for what they post.

(He claims I have marginalized myself and says he expects either no reply
from me or a venomous one.)


&gt;Well, this is a response. I don't think it's venomous. It's what I think.
&gt;
&gt;It's true that there are relatively few "primer" essays on Cypherpunks
&gt;these days; the time for that was in the early years, especially the first
&gt;year. Many of those essay writers who wrote long articles on public key
&gt;systems, signatures, etc., are now in the companies mentioned above. Plus,
&gt;having already done it there is little incentive to do it again.
&gt;
&gt;So? This is the natural evolution of any community.
&gt;
&gt;I'll stop now.
&gt;
&gt;All I can say is that if you find the Cypherpunks list no longer to your
&gt;liking, the choice is obvious. Or, if you want to stay but want the
&gt;discussions moved in other directions, write articles in these directions.
&gt;You can hardly complain if you're silent.
