the New Yoahkah just ran a piece on the gfriend-o-Brown.
Quite worth a read.  Most of the first paragraph below seems
sort of lifted from that article.

&gt;This item is one of many such articles outlining the corruptions within

&gt;
&gt;I don't usually forward items from "talk.politics.crypto," as I assume
&gt;many of you are already reading it. But this particular item fits with the
&gt;"Washington as crime capital in more ways than one" them I've been

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It's going to be a long hot summer for the Clinton
&gt;&gt; administration.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Wednesday night ABC Primetime did a special on Ron Brown's
&gt;&gt; girlfriend.  The accusations  flying around the dead Secretary
&gt;&gt; of Commerce do not bode well for the living inside the Beltway.
&gt;&gt; First, it seems that Ron acquired an offshore bank account with
&gt;&gt; nearly a million dollars deposited for him by the Government of
&gt;&gt; Vietnam.  Vietnam wanted to normalize trade relations with the
&gt;&gt; US and bribing the top dog at Commerce certainly helped grease
&gt;&gt; the skids.  Vietnam got their trade deal but Brown found out
&gt;&gt; that the FBI knew about his bank account.  So he could not touch
&gt;&gt; the money.  The bribery accusation is collaborated by an
&gt;&gt; ex-Vietnamese official who has also turned his evidence over to
&gt;&gt; the FBI.  Mr. Brown's girlfriend plans to testify before both
&gt;&gt; the Senate and the House committees investigating wrongdoing in
&gt;&gt; the Clinton administration.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Another revelation which should come as no shock is that the
&gt;&gt; First Lady put John Huang in the Commerce Department.  This
&gt;&gt; demand apparently did not sit well with Mr. Brown, who,
&gt;&gt; according to his girlfriend, did not like Mrs. Clinton.  It
&gt;&gt; seems that Ron's strong personality ran smack head on into
&gt;&gt; Hillary's demanding attitude.  Yet, he bent over backward and
&gt;&gt; made sure that Huang was hustled into his government position,
&gt;&gt; complete with a secret clearance.  Once Huang entered the
&gt;&gt; Commerce Department strange events really started to pop up.
&gt;&gt; The Commerce Department initially denied Huang had access to
&gt;&gt; anything important. It is now known that Huang attended dozens
&gt;&gt; of secret CIA briefings.  Huang is alleged to have discussed
&gt;&gt; secret materials with his former employers at the Lippo group.
&gt;&gt; The allegations come from material obtained by taps on Huang's
&gt;&gt; Commerce Department telephone.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can the same be said for Ira Sockowitz?  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; No.  Ira Sockowitz was placed into his Commerce position
&gt;&gt; directly and personally by President Clinton.  It was Ira
&gt;&gt; Sockowitz who ran Ron Borwn's airline seating arrangements,
&gt;&gt; between working on government affairs.  Whenever Mr. Brown would
&gt;&gt; fly on a government sponsored trade trip - Ira would line up big
&gt;&gt; Corporate powers to ride along on the party plane.  Mr.
&gt;&gt; Sockowitz had more experience as a DNC fund-raiser than security
&gt;&gt; software.  Despite this lack of technical skills Mr. Sockowitz
&gt;&gt; entered the field of banking security software at Commerce.  It
&gt;&gt; is the Commerce Department which approves or denies export of
&gt;&gt; such financial software.  The amount of money involved, invested
&gt;&gt; and possible returns, are staggering.  Obviously, the
&gt;&gt; push/pull/shove involved in getting such a product approved is
&gt;&gt; no easy task.  Few export licenses have been issued and those
&gt;&gt; who have them are not too anxious for any others to join them.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Just how easy was it to obtain such a privilege?  Not very.  Not
&gt;&gt; even Fortune 500 companies could obtain export rights from the
&gt;&gt; Commerce Department.  Letters from IBM, Motorola, Digital, HP
&gt;&gt; and a host of other billion dollar firms clearly indicate their
&gt;&gt; unsuccessful efforts to obtain Commerce licenses to export their
&gt;&gt; products.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; However, letters from certain other companies are covered with
&gt;&gt; redacted notes which the Commerce Department refuses to release.
&gt;&gt; One letter to the Commerce Department in particular was faxed to
&gt;&gt; someone (also redacted) along with a memo on how to obtain a
&gt;&gt; "waiver" for export.  Another set of Sockowitz documents being
&gt;&gt; withheld are a set of hand written notes on a conversation, a
&gt;&gt; three pages fax and two applications for license for export
&gt;&gt; dated 8/11/94.  The Clinton administration will not say who sent
&gt;&gt; the fax nor will they say who Ira Sockowitz talked to.  Yet,
&gt;&gt; clearly the topic was a license to export.  A license that could
&gt;&gt; have been worth billions of dollars.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It's going to be a long hot summer for the Clinton
&gt;&gt; administration.
