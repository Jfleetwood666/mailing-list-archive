well, the "presumption" has a somewhat stalinist aroma
to it, but as for the rest of this laughable proposal, 
I can't count a mind boggling number of constitutional 
problems. But I think we've had this talk before, on
another list.:)

&gt; Here is an example of a proposal being presented
&gt; at the White House today.
&gt; 
&gt; The minds boggles at the number of unconstitutional
&gt; provisions contained in such a brief text.

&gt; 
&gt; The Online Cooperative Publishing Act
&gt;                                      (SafeSurf's Proposal for a Safe
&gt; Internet Without Censorship)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;        Any law that seeks to regulate the Internet must first recognize the
&gt; uniqueness of the medium.  The Internet is not the print media or the
&gt;        broadcast industry.  It is also not another form of phone
&gt; conversation or a 900 number calling system.  Instead, the Internet is the
&gt;        manifestation of humankind's quest for limitless two-way interaction
&gt; with thought.  The hyper-text layout allows us to change topics on
&gt;        a whim, travel to distance places, or gather world opinion on a
&gt; subject in a matter of minutes. 
&gt; 
&gt;        This distinctive nature of the Internet must be protected and even
&gt; promoted by any legislation that claims to be fair to this medium.  The
&gt;        interaction between the one receiving data and the one publishing it
&gt; are where the core of the law should focus.  Both sides have rights,
&gt;        the publisher has the First Amendment and the receiver has the right
&gt; to be secure from harm in his home.  Proper Internet law should
&gt;        encourage a cooperative transfer of ideas in the form of data.  (It
&gt; should be noted that it was the universal acceptance of basic rules of
&gt;        cooperation, rather than anarchy, that built the Internet. )
&gt; 
&gt;        Any law that attempts to give one side or the other is given an
&gt; unreasonable burden in conducting the transfer of data is doomed to
&gt;        failure.  The CDA was too burdensome on the publisher.  Its goal was
&gt; to stop the flow of data, rather than to regulate it for the benefit
&gt;        of all parties. 
&gt; 
&gt;        On the other hand, without a proper law, parents can purchase and
&gt; activate measures to protect their children from adult material and still
&gt;        not feel secure in their homes from unwanted material.  This is
&gt; because negligent publishing of data eventually allows material that can
&gt;        harm the child to enter the home.  Once this material is experienced
&gt; by the child, its damage is done.  There is no "oops" factor, no way
&gt;        to undo the unwanted intrusion into a child's innocence. 
&gt; 
&gt;        Most importantly, any Internet law must not censor thought.  It may
&gt; regulate the labeling on the packaging but never the content. 
&gt; 
&gt;        With the goal of achieving a greater spirit of cooperation between
&gt; the publisher and the receiver of online data, we propose the Online
&gt;        Cooperative Publishing Act. 
&gt; 
&gt;        It shall contain the following provisions:
&gt; 
&gt;        1.      The right to be able to identify the adult rating of online
&gt; content before it enters one's home shall be established.  This shall be a
&gt;        civil right giving the violated person or family the presumption in
&gt; a suit against negligent publishers.
&gt; 
&gt;        2.      Negligent publishing of data shall be defined as placing
&gt; adult oriented material on the Internet in such a way or in such a location
&gt;        that it prevents its rating from being known.
&gt; 
&gt;        3.      A rating shall be defined as a PICS compatible label that
&gt; identifies degrees of adult content in a way that can be understood by
&gt;        computer filtering systems and is issued by a ratings service that
&gt; has a minimum of 5,000 documented individuals using its system to
&gt;        mark their data.
&gt; 
&gt;        4.      A publisher is defined as anyone who places computer data
&gt; where it can be accessed by the general public without the use of a
&gt;        credit card or other secure verified ID or password given out only
&gt; to adults.  Content that can be only be accessed by the use credit cards
&gt;        or other secure verified IDs is not subject to this law.
&gt; 
&gt;        5.      The code used to surround content published on the Internet
&gt; shall be defined as packaging.  All government identification
&gt;        requirements shall be limited to the code of the packaging.  Nothing
&gt; in this law shall be construed to require any altering or censorship
&gt;        of the content.
&gt; 
&gt;        6.      Three types of online publishing shall be defined:
&gt; 
&gt;              a) Publishers who accurately identify their data with a
&gt; recognized labeling system. 
&gt; 
&gt;              These publishers shall be considered to have satisfied the
&gt; labeling requirement of the law.  The right to publish shall be
&gt;              completely protected for those who accurately label their
&gt; material.  They shall be protected from all civil suits that argue
&gt;              negligent posting of data.  Only grossly mislabeled material
&gt; can be prosecuted.  (Note: This is not a protection for
&gt;              obscene material.  This law will offer no protection for
&gt; obscene material.)
&gt; 
&gt;              b) Publishers who mislabel their data to the degree that it
&gt; enables a minor using a label filtering
&gt;              system to gain access to harmful material.
&gt; 
&gt;              Data shall be considered to be mislabeled if it is posted in a
&gt; newsgroup, directory or other joint area that has been labeled
&gt;              as free from material harmful to minors.  Tampering with
&gt; another's label shall be crime.
&gt; 
&gt;              These publishers may be criminally prosecuted for subverting a
&gt; rating system to entice children to harmful material.  The
&gt;              mislabeling must be to the extent that it is completely
&gt; unreasonable to accept it as accurate.  Only ratings that are too
&gt;              lenient can be prosecuted.
&gt; 
&gt;              Posting unlabeled adult material to an area that has declared
&gt; itself safe for children or tampering with another's label shall
&gt;              be a severe criminal assault on the rights of the receiver.
&gt; 
&gt;              Sending unsolicited email to a minor that contains
&gt; pornographic material or an invitation to a pornographic Web Site, shall
&gt;              be considered negligent enticement and may be criminally
&gt; prosecuted.  A bulk email service sending pornographic email
&gt;              must show that it took reasonable measures to insure that
&gt; every recipient was an adult.  (Example: The addresses used
&gt;              were from the membership list of Adult Check or other such
&gt; adult verification services.)
&gt; 
&gt;              c) Publishers who do not label their data at all.
&gt; 
&gt;              Negligence in the absence of damages shall not be a criminal
&gt; offense (but it may be a civil violation of the rights of the
&gt;              receivers of that data) unless the data is deemed to be
&gt; harmful to minors.  Then the publisher will be prosecuted for
&gt;              negligence.
&gt; 
&gt;              These publishers may be sued in civil court by any parent who
&gt; feels their children were harmed by the data negligently
&gt;              presented.  The parents shall be given presumption in all
&gt; cases and do not have to prove the data actually produced harm
&gt;              to their child only that the material reasonably could be
&gt; considered to have needed a label warning to protect children.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;          7.      Internet Service Providers are considered publishers of
&gt; only that material of which they directly control or gain revenue via a
&gt;          percentage of sales.  Web Site designers may be held liable if
&gt; they fail to attach ratings to Web sites, containing material harmful to
&gt;             minors, they design for a fee. They may, by written agreement,
&gt; assign the task of rating to another legally responsible party.
&gt; 
&gt;        8.      Not every document is required to be labeled, only the
&gt; default or index document of each directory.  In the case of an entire web
&gt;           domain being of one rating, only its default top level document
&gt; needs to be labeled with instructions to apply it to the entire site. 
&gt;
