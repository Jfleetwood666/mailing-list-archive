There's been an ongoing discussion of the Huge Cojones remailer situation
on the related newsgroups.

This has a lot of relevance to our issues, and this is one of the more
illuminating articles.

&gt; : &gt; Only Jeff knows the whole story.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, not even I know the whole story.  If I truely knew who it was
&gt; that was orchestrating this attack, it would have stopped, one way or
&gt; another.  The problem is, I don't know all the players (I have some 
&gt; suspicions, which I'll elaborate on further in a little bit) but I don't
&gt; _really_ know who did it, and I really don't know why (other than a "I
&gt; don't like remailers, I think I'll shut one down").  And I really don't
&gt; know the background or what precipitated this.
&gt; 
&gt; : &gt; But I have to ask. Could this
&gt; : &gt; just be an" I'm sick of this shit, f**k it, I quit, who needs this
&gt; : &gt; aggravation, I'll just pull the plug and go have a beer" reaction
&gt; : &gt; to what really seems like a fairly small problem.
&gt; 
&gt; It is not a small problem anymore when you're getting &gt;200 complaint 
&gt; messages a day, plus 5-10 phone calls to your employer (and your
&gt; employer's legal department).  Fortunately, Wired is a very progressive
&gt; company, and supported my efforts to provide anonymity, but our lawyers
&gt; aren't paid to answer phone calls on my behalf.  Running a remailer is
&gt; one thing... getting harassed at work is an entirely different matter, and
&gt; getting a THIRD PARTY harassed at work is yet another one.
&gt; 
&gt; But yes, The ultimate "take this thing down" decision was one made 
&gt; because I was sick of this bullshit.  But you know what?  I volunteer
&gt; my time, my computer equipment, and bandwidth that is given to me
&gt; as part of my salary.  I do (well did) all of this because I believe
&gt; that anonymity is a right, and because I have the capabilities of
&gt; helping to provide anonymity to the masses.  When the remailer was
&gt; self-sufficient (before the attacks started), it took maybe 10 minutes
&gt; of my time a day, and minimal resources on my machine.  Afterwards, 
&gt; even after I put in the auto-blocking feature (send a blank message 
&gt; to a particular address and get your address blocked) and the 
&gt; autoresponder on the remailer-admin account, I was still getting &gt;100
&gt; messages a day reporting abuse... almost all of it spam-bait related.
&gt; I receive no benefit from running the remailer (I don't even use it
&gt; myself), and when it becomes a fairly major hassle without any 
&gt; rewards, the decision is not a hard one to make.
&gt; 
&gt; And frankly, I already have enough to do, and get enough mail on a
&gt; daily basis (at last check it was hovering around 600 messages/day).
&gt; As soon as the remailer started taking up a lot of my time, it became
&gt; time to rethink why I was running it.  The moment that the spam-baiter
&gt; started alerting people who had been baited, and telling them to 
&gt; contact me, it became personal.  And I don't have time to get into 
&gt; personal pissing-contests.  Yes, I took the easy way out, but that
&gt; was my choice to make.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone who doesn't run a remailer has very little right questioning my
&gt;  choice, because you have no idea what precipitated it.  Most people
&gt; reading this group have the capabilities of running a remailer (it only
&gt; takes a POP account and a Windows machine to run the Winsock remailer), 
&gt; but very few of us actually do.  Why is that?  I've been running huge.
&gt; cajones for just under 2 years, and it averaged just over 3000 messages
&gt; a day, so my remailer was responsible for about 2 million anonymous 
&gt; messages in its lifetime.  I think I've done my part (at least for now), 
&gt; it's time for someone else to do theirs.  If we had 15 disposable remailers
&gt; that operated for 2-3 months each before moving/going away, we'd have
&gt; paths for millions more anonymous messages.  And isn't that what we're
&gt; really trying to provide?
&gt; 
&gt; : The first was doing questionable things, like installing content-based
&gt; : filtering in an attempt to placate the attacker.  Giving in to the demands
&gt; 
&gt; When I first put the filters in, I was entirely unaware of exactly what
&gt; the hell was going on.  It seemed that someone had a bone to pick with
&gt; databasix, and was using the remailer to get databasix harassed by
&gt; third parties.  So, Burnore's complaint seemed reasonable at the time, and
&gt; I tried to come up with a way to block spam-bait abuse, without blocking
&gt; anything else (like a reply to burnore in Usenet).
&gt; 
&gt; See, if someone was doing to me what they appeared to be doing to Burnore, 
&gt; I would be pissed.  I figured placating him would be the best thing to
&gt; do.  In hindsight, I was wrong, but at the time, it seemed like the correct
&gt; decision.  (Also at the same time, the SPA threatened Wired with a 
&gt; lawsuit because of The MailMasher, so things were a little tense between
&gt; me and the legal department already, I didn't need to make them any worse.)
&gt; 
&gt; The final content-based-filter (there was an interim one) looked for the
&gt;  following things:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Any address at databasix (Yes, at the request of Burnore)
&gt; 2. Any address from my destination block list
&gt; 3. More than 5 addresses in a row, one line each, without other content
&gt;    in-between.
&gt; 4. Patterns of particular Usenet groups.
&gt; 5. Particular subject lines.
&gt; 
&gt; If any THREE of these items were spotted, the message got thrown into a
&gt; reject bin.  I periodically examined the reject bin, and can personally
&gt; attest that it didn't block ANYTHING that it wasn't intended to.  (The
&gt; test posts reeked of spam-bait to me, and I believe were correctly 
&gt; blocked)
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, the filters were removed about a week ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Because the filters were looking for a specific form of ABUSE, and not
&gt; just doing basic pattern matches, I don't consider them to be "content
&gt; filters".  I would think that just about anyone would agree that 
&gt; posting lists of email addresses to mlm newsgroups would qualify 
&gt; as abuse, and _should_ be blocked.   Blocking of this nature does NOT
&gt; restrict free speech (or at least that is not the intentions of it), and
&gt; it would keep the remailer out of lawsuit territory.
&gt; 
&gt; See, the big problem with lawsuits is not the fact that _I_ don't want
&gt; to be sued.  The problem is that anyone with half a brain can determine
&gt; that Wired is somehow related to any remailer that I am running on their
&gt; bandwidth.  Wired has deeper pockets than Mr. Burchell, so they are a
&gt; much better group to sue... and they are a lot more willing to give
&gt; in to a threat than I am.
&gt; 
&gt; : What I *MIGHT* have done was to respond as follows:
&gt; : 
&gt; :    Your legal demands are unacceptable.  I'd rather close the remailer than
&gt; :    compromise its integrity to suit your whims.  But understand this
-- unless
&gt; :    you withdraw your demands, I will not only close the remailer but
also make
&gt; :    damn sure all of its users know exactly who forced me to take this
action!
&gt; 
&gt; I did respond in a fashion much like this, about a week before the attacks
&gt; started coming.  Mr. Burnore requested a copy of my (non-existant) logs.
&gt; I told him to get me something in writing, signed by his lawyer that 
&gt; stipulated that the logs were confidential, and not to be revealed to 
&gt; anyone outside of the lawyer's office.
&gt; 
&gt; I received a letter from Belinda Bryan.  She is not registered with the
&gt; State Bar of California, and is thus, not a California lawyer.  I then
&gt; ignored the request, and forwarded the correspondence to the State 
&gt; Attorney General's office (as impersonating a lawyer in CA is defined
&gt; as fraud with extenuating circumstances).  They have been working with
&gt; me and the San Francisco DA's office.  Look out DataBasix... I'm not done
&gt; with you yet.
&gt; 
&gt; : The second mistake I perceive is not fully disclosing the circumstances that
&gt; : brought down Huge Cajones, and *NAMING NAMES*.  That way, even if the
remailer
&gt; : shuts down, other remailer operators will learn about the tactics employed
&gt; : against it, know *WHO* made the demands, etc.  IOW, when you get an innocent
&gt; : sounding, polite complaint from xxxx@yyy.com alleging "abuse", here's the
&gt; : scenario that's likely to follow ...  (It's not too late to make that
&gt; : disclosure, Jeff.)
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, now is the time to.  Making a disclosure like this while I 
&gt; was still running the remailer would have probably been a bad move.
&gt; Now that the remailer is closed, I'll name the names that I've got.
&gt; 
&gt; Beware... all of this is speculation, because huge.cajones was an 
&gt; anonymous service, not even I can say with any authority that any
&gt; of the people named below had anything to do with the shutdown of
&gt; huge.cajones (or The MailMasher).  However, there are a number of
&gt; coincidences of timing.
&gt; 
&gt; I still don't know what the hell is going on with DataBasix, Wells Fargo
&gt; and Gary Burnore, but I suspect that someone used huge.cajones to say
&gt; something extremely unflattering about Burnore (from what I can tell,
&gt; he had it coming).  Burnore then decided that he would make things 
&gt; difficult for me.  First, he wanted the user who had posted something
&gt; "inflammatory" about him revealed.  When I told him that I couldn't 
&gt; do that, he carried on about mail logs and identifying the host that
&gt; a message came from (the usual).  I didn't explain to him that my 
&gt; machine keeps logs, but not anything involving a *@cajones.com 
&gt; address.  He then requested the logs, which I denied (and told him
&gt; to get his lawyer to send a request...)
&gt; 
&gt; I'll admit, after my second or third contact with Mr. Burnore, I
&gt; no longer was particularly civil with the guy.  He's a kook, and
&gt; really didn't deserve my courtesy.
&gt; 
&gt; Between the time he first contacted me, and the time I received the
&gt; letter from Belinda Bryan, is when the baiting of databasix addresses
&gt; began (slowly, with just a few posts).  After a while, I received
&gt; requests from the other members of DataBasix (including William McLatchie
&gt; (sp) (aka wotan) who actually seems to be a remailer supporter (?)).
&gt; 
&gt; It was at this point that I realized something was completely amiss.
&gt; I asked McLatchie to please tell me the story of DataBasix, and he
&gt; said that he was going to, but never did.  Anyone who can tell me 
&gt; the story is invited to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; As a side note (and just because I am naming names).  Peter Hartly 
&gt; (hartley@hartley.on.ca) yesterday spam-baited me.  Fortunately, 
&gt; I've got good filters in place.  
&gt; 
&gt; As another side note, I've seen nothing to make me believe that Belinda
&gt; Bryan is even a real person.  Anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; : &gt; Given the importance of what Jeff was doing, I hope that he
&gt; : &gt; did all that he could, before declaring defeat. If that is the case,
&gt; : &gt; I commend him for a job well done. If not, why?
&gt; 
&gt; I can't claim to have done _everything_ that I could have done, but I 
&gt; did certainly make an effort.  I'm not willing to go to court to defend
&gt; a practice like spam-baiting (and given the current public-opinion situation
&gt; and impending anti-UCE legislation, this would be a terrible test-case).
&gt; 
&gt; I am not new to threats of lawsuit, even ones that come from legitimate
&gt; lawyers.  About 8 months previous, I was threatened repeatedly by the 
&gt; legal wing of the "Church" of Scientology.  I answered with a letter
&gt; from my lawyer that explained the policies of the remailer, and 
&gt; threatened a harrassment lawsuit if the "Church" contacted me again asking
&gt; for information (that they now knew I didn't have) about a remailer user.
&gt; They complied, and went away (and haven't been too difficult with 
&gt; other remailer operators lately).  
&gt; 
&gt; : Agreed.  Otherwise, these "asshole(s)" are simply going to do it all over 
&gt; : again against another remailer, eventually taking them all down one at
a time.  
&gt; Except that right now, new remailers are springing up.  If we could get
&gt; three more online for every one shut down, it wouldn't much matter, would
&gt; it?  I may very well end up running a mailer again in the future, but if
&gt; I do, it will probably be either a throwaway exit-man or a truely anonymous
&gt; middleman (i.e. nobody will actually know who is running it).  It also
&gt; will probably be hosted outside of the United States (Floating in 
&gt; international waters with a sat feed would be nice).
&gt; 
&gt; : It's time for them to stand up and say "Next time you come for one of us
&gt; : he's 
&gt; : not going quietly as the others have.  You'll have to face ALL of us
at once, 
&gt; : instead." 
&gt; 
&gt; Aah, you imagine much more solidarity among remailer operators than actually
&gt; exists.  It doesn't work that way.  It would be nice if it did, but many of
&gt; us are running remailers on borrowed bandwidth (or have other "situations"
&gt; to be concerned about).  Being the squeaky wheel is not always a good idea
&gt; for many of the operators (most of whom try to keep a low profile).  
&gt; 
&gt; The reality is, for all the good they do, remailers are tools that can 
&gt; very easily be abused.  And, as the internet gets more and more commonplace,
&gt; the average Joe and Joesphine, who don't have the strict Cyber-Libertarian
&gt; viewpoints that are shared by most of us old-timers, will start to wonder
&gt; just why anyone would want to run a service that allows anyone to speak their
&gt; mind without fear of reprisal.  When you get people with more extreme
&gt; viewpoints (the ones who have a really legitimate need for anonymity) posting
&gt; all kinds of stuff to all kinds of places, it will get the attention of
&gt; Middle-America, which will then bring it to the attention of legislators.
&gt; Any time a legislator can say "This is a blow to Child Pornographers and 
&gt; others who hide behind anonymity to commit crimes without fear of reprisal"
&gt; you can guarantee that the bill will pass.
&gt; 
&gt; When that happens, we're in trouble.  America is scared of computers, and
&gt; remailers are thought to be havens for the big 3 (Terrorists, Organized
&gt; Crime and Child Pornographers).  Now that the spammers are involved 
&gt; (spammers possibly being hated more than the big 3), most users are 
&gt; exposed to anonymous remailers in negative ways (Imagine what you would
&gt; think if the first time you heard about the existance of remailers, it
&gt; was because someone had spam-baited you, and then told you about it).
&gt; 
&gt; The right to anonymity in the US will be legislated away within 18 months, 
&gt; partially because of spam.  I do hope there's a _good_ test case waiting,
&gt; and someone willing to fight it to the end, but I have my doubts.  Ultimately
&gt; the remailer network will be forced to move offshore, the way Crypto 
&gt; development currently has.
