(***This is a one time only, limited offer.  You will not receive it again.  If I
do not hear from you, your name is automatically removed from my list.  Due
to overwhelming response, I must also limit the number of people allowed in
my program to preserve market effectiveness.***)

ALL I DO IS MAIL OUT 10 OF THE EXACT SAME SALES LETTER EVERY DAY!!    
                   
That is all that I do! I earn $140, $200, even $250 and more a day mailing out
the exact same sales letter. There is absolutely no catch or crazy gimmick
involved here, I promise you. This has nothing whatsoever to do with any 
ridiculous envelope stuffing program, illegal chain-letter scam, get rich quick
or worthless multi-level scheme!
 
There is not an easier or simpler way to make $140+ a day than this...
-- there can't be -- it's impossible! If you would like to retire on $140, $200, 
even $250 and more a day working only 1 hour each day then listen up...
  
I tried every money making plan under the sun. after three years of constant
attempts at striking it rich, I had done nothing but strike out.
 
I tried multi-level marketing... I failed!    
I tried chain letters... They failed me!
I tried envelope stuffing... What a joke!
I tried nine other various business ventures...
  
I was a fool. I didn't make much money. I can admit it, I was not the greatest
business person. I needed a way of making money that couldn't fail.
 
I worked hard about 50 hours a week cleaning houses. Many of my
customers were very wealthy. One of which was a thirtyish guy who drove
around in a Ferrari Testarossa. After cleaning his home he gave me the 
usual $20.00 tip and I asked him what he thought of the soap business. He 
started laughing so hard.

I'll never forget what he said, " Get a clue friend. You want to sell soap door
to door?  Did the fumes from your window cleaner go to your head or
something?  Someday when your serious about making money...
-- REAL Money -- call me and I will take you to school." I told him that I was
ready now and he said, " I don't have time today, but think about this. Why
sell soap?

People all over town sell it. No one could really care less where they got it
from.  Give people something that they want. I mean want bad, and be the 
only one with it. Think about that and come by the house tomorrow morning."
As he drove away, he stopped, smiled and said, " Wake up pal, valuable 
information sells."  I was dumbfounded. What did he mean? What was he 
talking about?
  
The next morning he gave me the information that would change my life!  In
thirty minutes he showed me a little known method that anyone can use to 
start making over $140 a day. At first I was skeptical. Who wouldn't be? His 
proven method was like nothing I had ever seen or heard of before.
  
Now I make over $140 a day working from home, at my leisure. It's so 
simple.  I sell information in a unique and exciting way. Every body wants it, 
only I can provide it!  I have even started my own little business doing 
exactly what I have described.  I have NEVER made less than $140 a day!
Most of the time it is much more...
 
"$2,500 a month "Guaranteed!!"  All you have to do is mail out my 
special sales letter which will be sent to you. You simply mail out 10 of 
these letters every day! ( 10 letters mailed = 7 responses). What I am trying
to say here is that my special sales letter pulls 70% orders.
 
Almost every sales letter you mail will bring back $20!  Other direct mailings 
get only 2% - 3% sales response, we get up to 70%! That's correct! This 
sales letter is a powerful money magnet. It's success has been fantastic. A 
test of your own will show that you will receive at least 7 customers for every
10 letters that you mail. Fantastic but true. Now you can make a fortune all
year round... every year.

The cost of my "Every-Day Cash Plan" is only $19.95, but it is worth much 
more than that because of it's success. Don't let the price of my "Every-Day 
Cash Plan" fool you. This is opportunity knocking! Don't pass it by. You will 
not receive this offer again! I'll send you everything to help you start making 
big money right away. I've compiled all of the information that you need to 
succeed in this business.
 
Try this test... send out 50 letters a week for a month... that's 200 sales 
letters. You will receive about 140 responses on a steady flow. This 
corresponds to about $3,200 a month if you only  send out 50 letters a week!
The success of the "Every-Day Cash Plan" will blow your mind when you ar
e receiving $20 checks and money orders by the dozen every day!! $2,500
a month Guaranteed!!
 
So if you'd like to earn thousands from "Every-Day Cash Plan"... take that first
important step. Simply fill in the order form below. I'm here waiting to help you
every step of the way.
