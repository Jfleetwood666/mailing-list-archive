&gt; 					United States Attorney
&gt; 					Western District of Washington
&gt; 
&gt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt; July 18, 1997
&gt; 
&gt; JAMES D. BELL PLEADS GUILTY TO OBSTRUCTING THE IRS AND USING FALSE SOCIAL
&gt; SECURITY NUMBERS
&gt; 
&gt; United States Attorney Kate Pflaumer announced that JAMES DALTON BELL, 39,
&gt; pleaded guilty today in the federal court in Tacoma to two felony charges.
&gt; BELL, a resident of Vancouver, Washington, pleaded guilty to obstructing and
&gt; impeding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and to falsely using a social
&gt; security number with the intent to deceive.  United States District Court
&gt; Judge Franklin D. Burgess presided over today's proceedings.
&gt; 
&gt; The charges stem from an investigation initiated in October, 1996 by IRS
&gt; Internal Security Inspectors into reports that BELL was gathering the names
&gt; and home addresses of IRS employees. In previous court hearings, IRS
&gt; Inspectors testified that BELL had obtained the names and home addresses of
&gt; 70 IRS employees as part of  "Operation LocatIRS." In the eight page plea
&gt; agreement signed by BELL, he acknowledged that he had gathered the names and
&gt; addresses of the IRS employees in order to intimidate them in the
&gt; performance of their official duties.
&gt; 
&gt; During the course of their investigation, IRS Inspectors discovered that
&gt; BELL was advocating a scheme called "Assassination Politics", whereby
&gt; persons would be rewarded with "digital cash" for killing certain
&gt; undesirable people.  BELL identified these undesirables as government
&gt; employees, such as IRS employees, who would be intimidated from enforcing
&gt; internal revenue laws for fear of being assassinated.  In the plea
&gt; agreement, BELL admitted that he suggested using "Assassination Politics" as
&gt; an enforcement mechanism for the "Multnomah County Common Law Court", and
&gt; that this was part of his effort to obstruct and impede the enforcement of
&gt; internal revenue laws.  In affidavits previously filed in this case, IRS
&gt; investigators identified BELL as a participant in the "Multnomah County
&gt; Common Law Court", which was described as a self-appointed anti-government
&gt; extremist group which purports to hold "trials" of IRS and other Government
&gt; employees for the performance of their official duties.  The affidavits
&gt; indicated that in January, 1997 the "Multnomah County Common Law Court" held
&gt; a "trial" of IRS and other Government officials.  
&gt; 
&gt; In the plea agreement, BELL also admitted that on March 16, 1997, he
&gt; conducted a chemical "stink bomb" attack on the IRS office in Vancouver,
&gt; Washington, using the noxious chemical mercaptan.  In affidavits filed with
&gt; the Court, IRS Inspectors tied BELL to two previous mercaptan attacks
&gt; against non-government targets: one being a lawyer's office in 1984, and the
&gt; other a vehicle in 1989.  The IRS investigators also linked BELL to two
&gt; purchase orders for noxious chemicals, one in 1994 and one in 1996.
&gt; According to the plea agreement, the attack on the IRS office resulted in a
&gt; cost to the government of $1,359, and caused a number of IRS employees to
&gt; have to leave work.  In an affidavit previously filed in this case, IRS
&gt; Inspectors indicated that the mercaptan attack may have been linked to the
&gt; February 20, 1997 seizure of BELL's vehicle by the IRS for unpaid taxes.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of the plea agreement, BELL also admitted that he used several
&gt; different social security numbers in order to hide assets from the IRS and
&gt; thus to impede the IRS's ability to collect taxes he owed and to prevent the
&gt; IRS from levying his wages.
&gt; 
&gt; Federal agents had previously executed two search warrants on BELL's
&gt; residence.  On April 1, 1997, IRS agents seized computers, documents, and
&gt; firearms during a search.  In a follow-up search, the Environmental
&gt; Protection Agency seized a variety of dangerous chemicals which had been
&gt; discovered during the execution of the  IRS warrant.  BELL was arrested by
&gt; IRS Inspectors on May 16, 1997.  BELL continues to be held in custody based
&gt; on a May 23, 1997 ruling by Magistrate Judge J. Kelley Arnold that BELL
&gt; posed a danger to the community and was a flight risk.
&gt; 
&gt; BELL faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine
&gt; for the obstruction charge, and five years and a $250,000 fine for using a
&gt; phony social security number.
&gt; 
&gt; The IRS received assistance in the investigation of BELL from the Portland
&gt; Police Bureau, Oregon Department of Justice, Oregon State Police, Federal
&gt; Bureau of Investigation, and the Vancouver, Washington Police Department.
