I did not see this on the list earlier, so I thought I'd post a copy.  This message says that the Executive Branch wants to know what we think about CA's, escrow, strong crypto, and other issues.

Anyone want to offer me a plane ticket to NIST in Gaithersburg, MD?

Issues for Public Comment and Themes of the Public Forum

The emergence of a public key infrastructure, and the demands of
global electronic commerce, have generated significant private sector
and governmental efforts to develop a reliable system of certificate
authorities that enable use of trustworthy digital signatures.

The Department of Commerce, and other Executive Branch agencies,
seek public comment on and are planning a Public Forum that encompasses
the following issues. By seeking comment from the varied parties and
interests, reflecting the many initiatives that are underway, the
Executive Branch will be better able to assess emerging initiatives on
digital signatures and certificate authorities; ensure that the federal
government's PKI activities take advantage of the latest developments
and directions in the private sector; and aid federal government
officials and industry representatives participating in domestic and
international fora on these issues.

    1. State government initiatives through ``digital signature laws.''
Some two dozen states have passed some form of ``digital signature
laws'' in the last two years. The Department encourages comments from
relevant state government agencies on the experiences and issues that
have arisen during the process of implementing these laws, including
the status of any registration of certificate authorities. Comments
that reflect the systematic aspects of digital signature laws are
especially encouraged. Comments are also encouraged by users and
stakeholders in the systems that result from passage of these ``digital
signature laws.''

    2. The evolving legal framework of certificate authorities and
digital signatures. A number of private sector efforts are underway to
examine and recommend changes to the legal and regulatory framework
that could contribute to a reliable system of certificate authorities.
The Department notes the efforts, among others, of the American Bar
Association (``Digital Signature Guidelines'') and the National
Commission on Uniform State Laws. The Department encourages comments
from all private sector efforts which are undertaking efforts in this
area.

    3. The technology and business challenges of certificate
authorities and digital signatures. In response to user demands, an
industry of certificate authorities is emerging. The Department seeks
comments from those entities that are offering services and
technologies that relate to issuing certificates and digital
signatures.

    4. User requirements and expectations. A multitude of sectors can
be expected to utilize a reliable system of certificate authorities and
digital signatures. The Department seeks comments from any and all
sectors that are developing performance requirements and user
expectations in this area. Comments are encouraged from non-profits and
governmental entities, as well as for-profit enterprises.

    5. An international perspective. A number of countries and
international fora are examining the issues of a reliable system of
certificate authorities and use of digital signatures. The Department
notes the activities of UNCITRAL, the OECD, as well as recent
developments in Germany, Japan, the European Union, etc. The Department
invites comments from international representatives on the issues
outlined in this notice and participation in the Public Forum.

Comments received in response to this notice will be made part of
the public record and will be available for inspection and copying in
the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020,
Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and
Constitution Avenues, NW, Washington, DC 20230. The Department intends
to publish the proceedings of the Public Forum, and all public
comments, as soon as possible after the July 24th meeting.

Dated: June 3, 1997.

Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology.
