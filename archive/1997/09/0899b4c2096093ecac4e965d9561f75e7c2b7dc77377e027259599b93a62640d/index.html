I have belonged to another telecom program and only 1 signup 
after 2 months. Giving away Free software that benifits the
buisness is GREAT!             Charles Blaisdell


Within 1 hour of me mailing the above letter out to recepients, I had 
3 people sign up for this business.  Within 4 days I had 8 people sign up.
By the end of the week I had 14 people on my 1st level and 3 on my second.
I didn't have to have any personal contact with them whatsoever. I'm at the 
end of my second week and I have over 25 people.  TEL3  Did it all!
