Feinstein answers her critics in the usual way slimy politicians
answer critics: Dodge the crucial details and make broad, sweeping,
feel-good but substance-less statments.

Here is my reply via a letter to the editor:

&gt; Date: Mon, 15 Sep 1997 13:31:10 -0700 (PDT)
&gt; From: Ernest Hua &lt;hua@chromatic.com&gt;
&gt; To: letters@sjmercury.com
&gt; Subject: Feinstein's ignorance on encryption ...
&gt;
&gt; As with the previous Mercury interview with William Reinsch,
&gt; I am extremely disappointed with this interview with
&gt; Feinstein.  There was absolutely ZERO attempt to ask
&gt; Feinstein to answer the tough policy questions in an open
&gt; forum where ALL facts are present (not just the distorted
&gt; information presented by the FBI in classified meetings).
&gt;
&gt; Look at these examples of the same tired arguments from the
&gt; FBI and the NSA, now being spewed by a senator who openly
&gt; admitted that she does not know much about the issue:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Q: Doesn't government control of encryption technology used
&gt; &gt; by American citizens infringe on their constitutional
&gt; &gt; rights?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A: No one is talking about intrusion on privacy rights. That
&gt; &gt; is important. I would not support an intrusion of privacy.
&gt;
&gt; Everyone outside the law enforcement and the intelligence
&gt; agencies ARE talking about privacy; that is why everyone
&gt; wants strong encryption.
&gt;
&gt; When some of the most vocal groups fighting for encryption
&gt; rights include privacy and civil liberty groups, I really
&gt; wonder where Feinstein gets her information.  Is this just
&gt; ignorance, living in denial, or "spin"?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ... When law enforcement authorities ... obtain a court
&gt; &gt; order, there should be some ability to act on behalf of
&gt; &gt; public safety.
&gt;
&gt; In fact, there is, but the entire focus as been on
&gt; encryption, as if, in case that door were closed off, law
&gt; enforcement and intelligence agents would be completely shut
&gt; out.
&gt;
&gt; Technology has enabled strong encryption, but technology has
&gt; also left a huge and UNENCRYPTED audit trail giving
&gt; significant clues to what the user has been doing.  San Jose
&gt; Mercury has even reported on one of the up and coming
&gt; companies taking advantage of these hidden and very
&gt; revealing trails of information to significantly boost a
&gt; civil or a criminal investigation.
&gt;
&gt; Law enforcement is not crippled by encryption.  They just
&gt; have to keep up with technology, which has offered them more
&gt; advantages than they've ever had before.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Encryption is already being used by criminals, terrorists
&gt; &gt; and drug cartels. ... Imagine the tragedies that might not
&gt; &gt; be prevented if law enforcement officials are unable to
&gt; &gt; decode encrypted files ...
&gt;
&gt; Law enforcement lobbyists like to paint this picture that
&gt; strong encryption is some sort of technological guarantee of
&gt; absolute secrecy which has crippled their investigations.
&gt; In fact, the FBI, when forced by court order to reveal the
&gt; facts, admitted that no investigations to date were really
&gt; obstructed.  Dorothy Denning, the only pro-law-enforcement
&gt; academic on this issue, confirmed this in her recent study.
&gt;
&gt; No wonder the FBI fought tooth and nail to keep their
&gt; internal memos from the public.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; People's safety must keep pace with new developments in
&gt; &gt; technology, or we will live to regret it. ...  In this
&gt; &gt; case, the industry is being asked to put people's safety
&gt; &gt; ahead of their bottom line.
&gt;
&gt; This is the sort of bogus public safety reasoning that the
&gt; FBI has been promoting.  There is not one single expert
&gt; outside law enforcement that believes criminals will
&gt; actually use any kind of government-mandated encryption.
&gt;
&gt; This is not 1960's.  Back then, strong encryption could not
&gt; possibly be in the hands of individuals because they require
&gt; very sophisticated computers to run.  Programming these
&gt; systems were considered black magic.  The few experts on the
&gt; topic were strongly censored by the NSA.
&gt;
&gt; Today, the same computing power is available in everything
&gt; from a personal computer to a smart toaster.  You can buy a
&gt; powerful chip for under $2.00 from Fry's.  Every
&gt; engineering, math and science graduate today must have
&gt; programming skills to be an effective employee.  Encryption
&gt; books are widely available, and the Department of State
&gt; admitted as much that they could no longer censor these
&gt; books, even from export to unfriendly nations.
&gt;
&gt; If a terrorist can build a bomb from a $5 watch, he can type
&gt; in a program to encrypt his plans.  So which nasty criminals
&gt; can the FBI really snoop on?  Certainly not the ones
&gt; building bombs from everyday appliances.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ... You replied that ``it seems to me that nothing but some
&gt; &gt; sort of mandatory key recovery does the job.'' Why?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A: There needs to be some means, within the strict confines
&gt; &gt; of due process of law, for recovery of encrypted information
&gt;
&gt; Feinstein is obviously not a Constitutional scholar here.
&gt; Where in the constitution does it say that law enforcement
&gt; must be GUARANTEED the means to eavesdrop in ANY
&gt; circumstance?  This sort of "make it up as it is convenient"
&gt; attitude is why many people have long questioned her ability
&gt; to genuinely protect civil rights.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Q: The National Research Council ... concluded that ... [the
&gt; &gt; risk of] ... unlimited encryption was outweighed by the
&gt; &gt; positive aspects of unlimited encryption, because that
&gt; &gt; provides the best opportunity for government, corporate
&gt; &gt; and individual computer users to protect themselves from
&gt; &gt; computer crime.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; A: ... encryption ... already is being used in some of the
&gt; &gt; most serious crimes. ... Law enforcement officials must
&gt; &gt; maintain the ability to pierce encrypted communications in
&gt; &gt; these kinds of criminal operations.
&gt;
&gt; This is another dodge of the real question: Most of the
&gt; members of the NRC panel ALSO got the classified briefing.
&gt; These are the technical and policy experts (that's why they
&gt; are on the panel in the first place).  What makes Feinstein
&gt; think she is so much smarter than these experts, despite her
&gt; claims of ignorance on the matter?
&gt;
&gt; Let's be realistic:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Feinstein has a very warped view of the Bill of Rights
&gt; because she has been the target of, among other things, a
&gt; letter bomb.  She is running scared, and will demand nothing
&gt; short of a crack down from law enforcement, so we cannot
&gt; expect her to side with anyone AGAINST the wishes of law
&gt; enforcement.  (Just look at her stance on the issue of
&gt; freedom of speech on the Internet.)
&gt;
&gt; 2.  Feinstein has clearly stated in previous senate hearings
&gt; that she is ignorant on this matter, and that she will
&gt; definitely defer judgement to the law enforcement agencies.
&gt; Well, she has once again proven her ignorance, but at least
&gt; she's admitted it in the past.  The trouble is that she goes
&gt; on to take significant policy positions on the matter
&gt; anyway.  Why speak up so strongly on a topic where she's so
&gt; clueless?
&gt;
&gt; 3.  Feinstein, like many politicians, does not want to deal
&gt; with the details of issues because it would mean that she
&gt; would have to make some very TOUGH questions and decisions.
&gt; The high tech industry is absolutely against encryption
&gt; regulations, so she is in a tight spot.  No wonder, in that
&gt; same senate hearing, she left the room before her
&gt; constituents showed up to testify.
&gt;
&gt; It's difficult to force a coward face reality and answer to
&gt; real world concerns, and let us keep in mind that the FBI
&gt; and the NSA have insisted on secret meetings rather than
&gt; open discussions on this issue.  They simply do NOT want to
&gt; have to face open scrutiny.  No matter how big a favor they
&gt; THINK they are doing for us, they must be reminded that this
&gt; is an open and democratic society, and that they may not
&gt; choose to have a secret meeting just because they cannot win
&gt; in open debate.
