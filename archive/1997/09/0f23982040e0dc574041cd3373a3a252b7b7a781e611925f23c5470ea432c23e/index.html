this program is VERY HIGH, VERY FAST, and you receive your cash in about 
30 DAYS.  That's only FOUR WEEKS - not three months.  Just in time to

"The first time I received $3,000 in cash in two weeks, and then $7,000 in 
cash the next three times". "THIS CAN DO IT FOR YOU"!!!

in a program, continue to stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE 
as well; RIGHT NOW!!! It is simple and takes a very small investment - not 
hundreds of dollars. It will pay you before your other programs begin to trickle in.

Just give the three (3) people below $5.00 each (by way of the monitor),and 
request a report from each one of them. Don't forget to include your name, 
mailing address, and e-mail address. You will replace #3 on the list below. #3 
moves to the #2 position. #2 moves to the #1 position. #1 is then removed from 
the list. Follow the simple instructions below, and in FOUR WEEKS, you will 
have at least $5,000, because most PEOPLE WILL RESPOND due to the LOW 
INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL. So let's all keep it 
going, and help each other in these tough times.
