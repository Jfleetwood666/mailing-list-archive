        Loads of things happened on October 18.
       We're not going to tell you which one to
    commemorate.  That's up to you.  Check out the
 birthdays and historical events listed below.  Pick
      one or go with something else.  Your call.

      But no matter what theme you pick, it IS a
      masquerade ball, so you MUST wear a costume
         (or at least a mask).  NO EXCEPTIONS.

       (Please, adults only.  We regret that our
        house is very unsuitable for children.)

                   THE ENTERTAINMENT

OCTOBER 18 IN HISTORY

This is "Any Way You Look at It" Day! 

On this day in 1961, Henri Matisse's painting, "Le Bateau" 
went on display in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.  
For six days, nobody realized it was hanging upside down.

1842 - Samuel Finley Breese Morse, laid his first telegraph 
cable in New York Harbor between the Battery and Governor's 
Island.

1892 - The first long-distance telephone communication was 
established between the mayors of New York and Chicago.

1924 - The term "Four Horsemen" was used in a "New York Herald 
Tribune" article by columnist Grantland Rice.  The referenced 
Four Horsemen were the backfield of the University of Notre Dame 
which had beaten Army, 13-7. 

1935 - Victor record #25236 was recorded this day by Tommy Dorsey 
and his Orchestra. It would become one of the most familiar Big 
Band themes of all time: "I'm Getting Sentimental Over You". 

1943 - The first broadcast of "Perry Mason" was presented on CBS 
Radio. In the 15-minute (Monday-Friday) shows, Perry was played by 
Barlett Robinson, Santos Ortega, Donald Briggs and John Larkin. 
Larkin played the role the longest and was reportedly very 
disappointed when Raymond Burr got the gig on TV (1957). 

1944 - The epic book, "Forever Amber", was published.  This 
historic-romance novel was written by Kathleen Windsor. Although 
the book was very popular among women between the ages of 12 and 
24, it was considered scandalous to be seen reading it; a reaction 
that lasted at least another three decades. 

1956 - Football commissioner Bert Bell turned thumbs down on the 
use of radio-equipped helmets by NFL quarterbacks.  

1971 - The final issue of "Look" magazine was published. It had 
been a must-see publication every week for 34 years. 

1977 - Reggie Jackson made history and earned the nickname, 
Mr. October.  Regg-a-roo (as Howard Cosell called him) hit three 
home runs on three successive pitches leading the Yankees to an
8-4 thrashing of the LA Dodgers in Game 6 of the World Series. 

1979 - Following extensive renovation to return Radio City Music 
Hall to the look and feel of its 1931 Art Deco glory, the 
venerable New York City theatre reopened. "Snow White and the 
Seven Dwarfs" was the first live presentation. 

1983 - Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton received some gold to add 
to their collections --for their smash, "Islands in the Stream".
