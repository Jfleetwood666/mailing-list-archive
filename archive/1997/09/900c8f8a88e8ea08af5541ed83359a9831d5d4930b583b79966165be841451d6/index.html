What is FC98?
- -------------

FC98, the world's only peer-reviewed conference on financial cryptography,
will be held Monday through Thursday, February 23-26, 1997, at the
Inter-Island Hotel on the Caribbean island of Anguilla.

In conjunction with the conference, the Inter-Island Hotel will also be
the site of an intensive 40-hour workshop for senior managers and IS
professionals the week after the conference (March 2-6), and a
concurrent exhibition of financial cryptography products and services
during the entire week of the conference itself, February 23-27.

The goals of the combined conference, workshop, and exhibition are:

- -- to provide a peer-reviewed forum for important research in financial
cryptography and the effects it will have on society,

- -- to give senior managers and IS professionals a solid understanding of
the fundamentals of strong cryptgraphy as applied to financial
operations on public networks, and,

- -- to showcase the newest products in financial cryptography.

In addition, time has been reserved in the afternoon and evening for
sponsored corporate presentations, functions and activities, and for
business
networking.

Conference participants are encouraged to bring their families.


The Conference
- --------------


Ray Hirschfeld, the conference chair, has picked an outstanding group of
professionals and researchers in financial cryptography and in related
fields to review the papers for this conference.

They are:

Chair: Rafael Hirschfeld, CWI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Co-Chair: Matthew Franklin, AT&amp;T Laboratories--Research, Florham Park, NJ,
USA

Matt Blaze, AT&amp;T Laboratories--Research, Florham Park, NJ, USA
Antoon Bosselaers, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium
Yves Carlier, Bank for International Settlements, Basel, Switzerland
Walter Effross, Washington College of Law, American U., Washington DC, USA

The actual agenda of the conference will be determined by the papers the
program committee selects. The conference committee is selecting papers in
what it considers the union, rather than a strict intersection, of the
fields of finance and cryptography.

For last year's program please see &lt;http://www.offshore.com.ai/fc97/&gt;.

Original papers are being solicited on all aspects of financial data
security and digital commerce in general, including:


    Anonymous Payments                      Fungibility
    Authentication                          Home Banking
    Communication Security                  Identification
    Conditional Access                      Implementations
    Copyright Protection                    Loss Tolerance
    Credit/Debit Cards                      Loyalty Mechanisms
    Currency Exchange                       Legal Aspects
    Digital Cash                            Micropayments
    Digital Receipts                        Network Payments
    Digital Signatures                      Privacy Issues
    Economic Implications                   Regulatory Issues
    Electronic Funds Transfer               Smart Cards
    Electronic Purses                       Standards
    Electronic Voting                       Tamper Resistance
    Electronic Wallets                      Transferability

Proceedings of Financial Cryptography 1998 will be published by Springer
Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

For further information on the submission process, please see the program
committee's web-page at &lt;http://www.cwi.nl/conferences/FC98&gt;.


Last year, the conference was been covered by The New York Times,
Institutional Investor, the Financial Times, Wired Magazine, NHK Japan, and
other media. In addition, financial cryptograpy and several of last year's
conference participants and sponsors were the subject of a cover story in a
September issue of Forbes Magazine.

If last year's interest in this conference is any indication, it is
probably a good idea to register for FC98 and make your plane and hotel
reservations as soon as possible, as conference, workshop, and exhibit space
is extremely limited, and we anticipate selling out all three events.

The price of a pass to the conference sessions and exhibits is US$1,000,
with discounted rates for full-time academics and students of $250 and
$100 respectively.  You can pay for your FC98 conference ticket with
Visa or MasterCard, or any of a number of other internet commerce
payment protocols, at the regstration site, &lt;http://www.fc98.ai/&gt;.

The price includes breakfast and lunch. Internet connectivity will also be
provided at the conference site.


The Exhibition
- --------------


The FC98 Exhibition is an exclusive trade show for financial
cryptography products and services. The trade show floor will be open
from 9:00 am to 5 pm the entire week of the conference Monday through
Friday, February 23-27. In addition, the conference facility will be
open for commercial presentations and demonstrations in the afternoons
Tuesday through Thursday, and all day on Friday. Each booth will have
high bandwidth access to the internet, and will get 3 conference passes.
Booth prices start at $5,000 US. Please contact Julie Rackliffe at
&lt;mailto:rackliffe@tcm.org&gt; for further information. As space is limited,
please reserve your space as soon as possible.


The Workshop
- ------------

We are again honored to have Ian Goldberg as the leader of the FC98
Financial Cryptography Workshop, which will run one week after the
conference, March 2-6, 1998.

Ian, the cryptographer at Berkeley who is now famous (in articles in the
Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and Forbes) for breaking several
financial cryptography transaction protocols, will be running an intensive,
5-day workshop for senior managers and technology professionals.

While the workshop is still being developed, and will depend on the
skills of the planned participants, Workshop topics will include, but
not be limited to:

Overview and background of cryptography
Survey of existing and proposed Internet payment systems
Details on some specific payment systems
Issues involved in setting up a secure Internet site
A step-by-step walkthrough of setting up a digital bearer certificate mint.

Ian has recruited a strong roster of instructors with credentials
similar to his own, and, as he plans to maintain a 5-1 student/teacher
ratio, the size of the Workshop will be restricted and advance
registration will be required.

Further information about the Workshop can be found at:

&lt;http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~iang/fc98/workshop.html&gt;

The planned price for the workshop is $5,000. This covers lab space,
hardware, network access, software, meals, and, of course, 40 hours of
instruction and structured lab activity. The lab itself will be open 24
hours a day.


Sponsorship Opportunities
- -------------------------

FC98 offers sponsorship opportunities at all levels. Businesses are
encouraged to be an exclusive sponsor for lunch or dinner in conjunction
with a networking/recreational activity of some kind. Sponsorship provides
corporations with a unique opportunity to get their message heard by the
best people in the field of financial cryptography, and to gain
unprecedented exposure for their business.  Sponsorships start at
$10,000, and include one booth, discounts on additional booth space, 5
conference passes, mention of your company in all FC98 communications
(like this one), and a sponsored lunch or dinner and
networking/recreational activity for the conference participants.

In-kind sponsorship is also available, with opportunities for companies
to provide networking, bandwidth, software, hardware, radio packet
modems and equipment, as well as web-design and print services,
and transportation.

The sponsorship contact is Julie Rackliffe &lt;mailto: rackliffe@tcm.org&gt;.



Air Transportation and Hotels
- -----------------------------

Air travel to Anguilla is typically done via San Juan, Puerto Rico, or
St. Maarten. There are several non-stop flights a day from various US and
European locations to St. Maarten. Connection through to Anguilla can be
made through American Eagle, or through LIAT, not to mention a short,
inexpensive ferry service from St. Martin to Anguilla. See your travel
agent for details. American Eagle Airlines has agreed to increase their
flights as needed to accomodate any extra traffic the conference brings to
the island.

There is also discussion of a "crypto-plane" charter making a
transcontinental run from San Jose to St. Maarten by way of Las
Vegas, Minneapolis, and JFK/New York. We're still working on it. Let
Robert Hettinga &lt;mailto: rah@shipwright.com&gt; know if you're interested
in this idea.

Anguilla's runway is 3600 feet, with a displaced threshold of 600 feet,
and can accomodate business jets.

Anguilla import duties are not imposed on hardware or software which
will leave the island again, so, as long as you take it with you when
you leave, you won't pay import duties on the things you bring.

Hotels range from spartan to luxurious, and more information about
hotels on Anquilla can be obtained from your travel agent, or at
&lt;http://www.fc98.ai/&gt;.
