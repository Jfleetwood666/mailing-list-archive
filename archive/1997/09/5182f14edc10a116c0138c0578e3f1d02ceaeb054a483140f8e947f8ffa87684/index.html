If you received this electronic mailing by mistake, please pardon our intrusion.

Dear Friend,

Are you or somebody that you know experiencing credit problems?  If your answer is yes, I think you will be very interested in our special offer. No longer will you have to live like a second class citizen due to a bad credit report. Bad credit is caused by a variety of reasons:  Health, divorce, termination of employment, loss of income and dozens of other reasons. The bottom line is that bad credit can happen to anybody.  There is no specific profile of a person with credit problems. It can happen to doctors, lawyers, accountants, the mail man, truck drivers, housekeepers and salesmen. As a matter of fact, one in three Americans live with some form of bad credit. Fortunately, the United States Government has passed many laws under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, all of which protect your rights as a consumer. Our manuals will show you how to use these Federal laws to your advantage and repair or obtain a new credit report.

            ***** THE FRESH START PROGRAM (TM) *****

Have you seen your credit bureau report lately?  Have you recently been denied credit because of a bad cedit report? If you have answered yes, then you need to take advantage of THE FRESH START PROGRAM (TM). THE FRESH START PROGRAM (TM) will guide you through the process of obtaining a BRAND NEW credit bureau report. Our easy-to-follow manual will put you on the fast track to obtaining your new credit bureau report and can be accomplished within 24 hours! Regardless of your credit rating, you can NOW obtain a brand new, fresh credit bureau report free of:

		*  ANY bad credit
		*  Bankruptcies
		*  Judgements
		*  Foreclosures
		*  Charge-Off's
		*  Tax Lien's
		*  Repossessions
		*  Late pays
		*  Garnishments
		*  Inquiries

NOW, you can have a 'Clean Slate' and a 'FRESH START' with a brand new, credit bureau report.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

            ***** THE COMPLETE CREDIT REPAIR KIT (TM) *****

Good credit empowers you to qualify for personal loans, business loans, auto loans, credit cards, home loans and other types of credit you may apply for, at the best possible interest rate. As you know, if you don't have excellent credit, lenders will NEVER extend credit to you! The Fair Credit Reporting Act will allow you to legally and permanently ERASE the negative information on your credit bureau file. Anything that is damaging to your credit rating, may be removed:
Inquiries, Foreclosures, Repossessions, Charge-Off's, Late Payments
Student Loans, Bankruptcies and Judgements

The 'Credit Repair' companies located in every city will charge from $500.00 and up to do what our easy-to-follow manual will teach you. Now, in the privacy of your own home, you can repair your own credit at your own pace.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

                        ***** PROOF *****

"Having bad credit was the one thing holding me back from starting my own business. After working your program, I qualified for a $45,000 Small Business Loan. My business is making me more money than I've ever made.  Your program is truly priceless!"
					George S.  -  Fresno, CA.

"Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Before, my credit was totally trashed. After using your Fresh Start Program and using The Complete Credit Repair Kit, my wife and I qualified to purchase our first home with no down payment. These programs are worth thousands of dollars!"
					Kenneth T.  -  Ithica, NY

"After being laid off, my creditors were not very understanding when I couldn't pay my bills and as a result, my credit was very badly damaged.  Once I started working again, I couldn't qualify for any type of credit. After using the manuals, I qualified to buy a new car, with no down payment."
					Mr. Fred C.  -  Tampa, FL

"After my divorce, I was forced to file bankruptcy.  I was told my credit would be ruined for 10 years. After using the your manuals, I have great credit again.  I even receive pre-approved credit cards in the mail. Thank you so much for your amazing program.  I don't know what I could have done without it. I highly recommend your program to anyone who has credit problems."
					Ms. Anna S.  -  Tacoma, WA
