Net Worth, Net Work:
Technology &amp; Values for the Digital Age

Saturday and Sunday
October 4 &amp; 5
University of California - Berkeley
Dwinelle Hall

The "information highway" as a business model has generated major questions
concerning privacy, security and free speech. It's clear that digitization
does
more than just turn analog activities into ones and zeroes. Many aspects of
our
society are greatly affected -- how we conduct business and how we work. This
conference will focus on the burgeoning digital economy, especially its impact
on wealth and jobs.

We are moving into a new era for the workplace and some believe that we are
reaching "the end of work," as we know it. This change has been compared by
some
to the social impact of the industrial revolution. The "digital revolution" is
leading to both predictable and unforeseen transformations. Net Worth, Net
Work:
Technology &amp; Values for the Digital Age will explore the many aspects of this
epic social transformation.

THE CONFERENCE AGENDA

PANELS:
Saturday, October 4
9:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.

THE TECHNOLOGIES OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS
What are the technologies that will make digital commerce work in a socially
responsible manner? Nathaniel Borenstein of First Virtual and a panel of
digital
commerce experts will present an overview of the tools of the digital age and
freewheeling discussion of their responsible use.

ACCESS FOR ALL
New technologies are rapidly changing what people need to know to compete
effectively in the job market. It is increasingly evident that the technology
revolution threatens to leave whole populations behind --despite improved
access
to computers in our communities. Many predict the long-term result will be
a new
generation of Americans mired in low-paying, menial jobs. This panel,
organized
by Madeline Stanionis of Access to Software for All People (ASAP), will
explore
access to technology as the basis for economic opportunity.

FAIRLY FREE: Compensating Creators and Maximizing Access
As the slogan goes, "information wants to be free" -- and in digital
technologies there is a plethora of information. Computer libertarians
sometimes
find themselves at odds with commercial publishers, and in a sometimes uneasy
relationship with creators -- writers, photographers, graphic artists -- who
want to be fairly compensated when others profit from their work. What is the
public's stake in translating traditional principles of copyright, piracy and
fair use into the media environment of the 21st century?

SHOW ME THE MONEY
The economics of the digital age are quite different from that of our waning
industrial world. From the "market of one" to global banking, value is no
longer
measured in tons or shiploads, but in much more difficult to measure units
like
"attention" and "clickstream." Speculation about the future in this area
rivals
some of the greatest science fiction ever written. The question is not only
where are we going, but is there anything we do about it?
