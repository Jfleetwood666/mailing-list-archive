&gt; &gt;no longer trusted Gilmore to
&gt; &gt;host the list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On the planet I live on, the list moved because Gilmore was no longer
&gt; &gt; willing to host the list
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand the majority of the list members, including myself,
&gt; would say that the reason the list moved was because  of the
&gt; censorship imposed by statist cocksucker Gilmore.
&gt;
&gt; The list rapidly disentigrated into infighting and flame wars as soon
&gt; as the censorship was announced, several people suggested new list
&gt; solutions before Gilmore anounced he was closing the list, I remember
&gt; talking in private email with Igor and several others about the
&gt; distributed mailing list solution immediately the censorship was
&gt; announced.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Question:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this true dissinformation or does this scumbag  Russian sociopath
&gt; &gt; believe his own lies?
&gt;
&gt; Question:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is this bot generated or does "Casey Iverson" really exist? - I
&gt; would say he is a real person due to the level of context sesitivity and
&gt; quoting in his posts, however, it is beyond my comprehension that
&gt; anyone could be this inane...

Unfortunately, New York City is the home to several people who in a
more restrictive society would have been committed - Case Iverson,
Ray Arachelian, the lying crackpot Charles Platt from alt.torture...

&gt; 2. If "Casey" does exist does he suck John Gilmore`s cock or is he
&gt; more of a Sandfort man?

Neither Gilmore nor Sandfart have cocks long enough to reach from
California... But Iverson may be sucking Arachelian's cock.

&gt; 3. Could the level of stupidity in his posts be easily emulated by a perl
&gt; script or would this require more complicated code including inducing
&gt; gramatical errors, anti Russian rants and turns of phrase that simply
&gt; fail to scan right in the context in which they are generated?

With difficulty. A program's output would likely sound more intelligent.

&gt; 4. Is there a low bandwidth stego channel hidden in his rants, with
&gt; the data transmitted as integers giving the apparent IQ of the writer
&gt; for each message?

Yes, but it's a very low bandwidth channel capable of transmitting
single digits only.

&gt; 5. If he does exist and is sentient is he an NSA schill wasting our
&gt; time and effort to stop us doing crypto?

A very good point, Paul.

You may have noticed that Cocksucker John Gilmore spreads lies and
disinformation, he makes up hard numbers which can be proven to be false -
but it would require an effort that could be used more productively e.g. on
setting up more remailers. Consider several of Cocksucker John Gilmore's
recent claims made through his subservient mouthpiece Rich Graves. In
article &lt;5gl63i$4eu@quixote.stanford.edu&gt; Cocksucker John Gilmore wrote:

&gt;comparing me to Vulis doesn't work, I don't think. He'd have
&gt;mailbombed the list subscribers at the drop of a hat; and in
&gt;the case of cypherpunks, he and GruBoursy did, to such an
&gt;extent that the list had to move from toad.com to cyberpass.net.
&gt;I'm sure I've disappointed some people by doing nothing of the
&gt;kind. Doesn't stop Seth from saying I'm obsessed, of course.

This is a lie. I haven't mailbombed cypherpunks. There were several mail
loops during the list's existance on toad.com, none of which were caused by
me. The list moved because of Gilmore's censorship, which Graves forgets to
mention at all. list. In article &lt;5gkfag$36o@quixote.stanford.edu&gt;
Cocksucker John Gilmore/Graves further wrote:

&gt;&gt;In any case, I personally would not ever absolutely reject posts
&gt;&gt;arbitrarily from someone if I was moderating a list, even if 99.9% of
&gt;&gt;their posts were absolute junk.  (I've been in such situations---try
&gt;&gt;moderating an biological evolution newsgroup and fend of all the
&gt;&gt;creationists.)
&gt;
&gt;You've never met Dr. Vulis, then. Imagine 50 messages a day like this:
&gt;
&gt;http://infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks/dir.archive-96.10.24-96.10.30/

The cypherpunks mailing list is archived at several sites. As I pointed out,
it's possible to search the archives and to verify that in the several years
that I've been on this list, there was not a single day when I posted 50
articles; not a single day when I posted even 15 articles; and probably less
than 10 days when I posted more than 5 articles. Cocksucker John Gilmore
is lying again. In the same article Gilmore/Graves wrote:

&gt;Vulis also posted megabytes of Serdar Argic screeds, just to be annoying,
&gt;and with the stated intention of disrupting the list. That's called a
&gt;denial of service attack.

More lies. I have repeatedly stated that it is NOT my intention to disrupt
the mailing list. The total size of the Serdar Argic material is under 200K.
I'd be surprised if the total size of my contributions to cypherpunks over
the years adds up to more than a couple of megabytes.

But of course we know that Cocksucker John Gilmore is a pathological liar,
so we can do something more useful than digging through the archives.
