]&gt;Warning: The Happynet Unofficial Anti-Censorship Committee has determined
]&gt;the following post to be inappropriate for children and fight-censorship
]&gt;subscribers. Only Seth Finkelstein has been empowered to speak the whole
]&gt;truth by the anti-censorship review board. Please enter the following into
]&gt;your killfile:
]
]	Rich is getting nuttier and nuttier. This is not
]unexpected. His pattern is to get more and more slimy as you argue
]with him. Note that the fact that he argues with people who are
]themselves very vile people, Holocaust-deniers, does not change the
]demonstrated truth of this statement. This is again why many people
]end up just ignoring him completely and not wanting to read anything
]from him.
]
]&gt;Seth is nothing if not a reasonable unbiased observer. Trust him. Please.
]
]	And I've noted many a time, my qualification is I-was-there.
]I have, however, repeatedly tried to resolve this dispute and read all
]your articles (aggravating though it is almost all of the time). That
]should be worth something.
]
]&gt;No, I mean it. From articles &lt;5ghg1t$7j4$5@nntp2.ba.best.com&gt; and
]&gt;&lt;5ghg1n$7j4$4@nntp2.ba.best.com&gt;, just to be sure I guess:
]&gt;
]&gt;|Rich, have you ever wondered why so many diverse people, with wildly
]&gt;|diverse political views, have accused you of being a left or center
]&gt;|fascist or a commie sympathiser.
]&gt;|
]&gt;|And no, the, fact that you have been accused of being a commie symp is
]&gt;|not evidence that those who called you a fascist were wrong, and vice
]&gt;|versa.  The various political positions you have been accused of, tend
]&gt;|to be hard to distinguish in practice.
]
]	I suspect this is some sort of a trap, but, noting that I am
]walking into this with my eyes open and aware of it: Rich has lied
]here, and in all the referenced quotes below. They are not from me,
]but someone else. By this tactic, he hopes to imply that if I call him
]a liar, and someone else (say a Holocaust-denier) does the same thing,
]both are equally valid. It is exactly the trick I just detailed a
]posting or two ago, imposing moral equivalence on his critics.
]	But note, he did not have to lie in the above to do this
]rhetorical tactic. He could have tried to pull it off by contrasting
]similar-sounding, but correctly-attributed, quotes. But he did not, he
]lied repeatedly. There is no way this sort of thing can be explained
]by benefit of the doubt or a human error or believing separate
]reports. It is a malicious and knowing fabrication. By the standards
]Rich espouses (for other people ...)  this should condemn him for all
]eternity.
]
]&gt;And article &lt;5gi741$cbp$1@nntp2.ba.best.com&gt;:
]&gt;
]&gt;|Another example of your disturbing affection for state informers and
]&gt;|government goons with guns.
]&gt;[...]
]&gt;|I have no idea what these claims are, but I confidently believe a
]&gt;|couple of things about you that you have forcefully denied.
]
]	Didn't write that. I don't care what Rich thinks about guns,
]though I wonder if he should be in one of the groups which should
]certainly be denied them (... history of mental illness).
]
]&gt;And article &lt;5gmff0$109$4@nntp2.ba.best.com&gt;:
]&gt;
]&gt;|You are a habitual liar, an apologist for state repression, and a
]&gt;|loon.
]
]	Didn't write that. I don't know about "habitual", but I suppose
]it's arguable. I don't care about Rich's politics. Loon, DEFINITELY!
]
]&gt;And &lt;5gqbd5$rkm$2@nntp2.ba.best.com&gt;:
]&gt;
]&gt;|You piously declare you are on the side of the angels, while
]&gt;|systematically circulating lies that hurt us and benefit the enemy.
]
]	Didn't write it, but I could have :-). But the trick there is
]that "the enemy" could mean in the writer's mind "The Jewish Conspiracy",
]but in my mind "Sensation-Mongering Journalists". The two statements
]then may *sound* alike, but actually be completely different.
]
]&gt;And &lt;5gu8v6$nf$2@nntp2.ba.best.com&gt;:
]&gt;
]&gt;|Rich regularly circulates "facts" that are systematically off base in
]&gt;|ways that legitimize and justify the lawless acts of governments and
]&gt;|which denigrate peoples rights.
]
]	Didn't write it, again, I very rarely deal with Rich's
]general beliefs about government. I get far too much of him as it is.
]
]&gt;|When called on these he then piously whines how much in favor of
]&gt;|liberty he is.
]&gt;|
]&gt;|He is damned statist liar.
]
]	Didn't write it, wouldn't say "statist liar". Of course, this
]repeated tactic of misattribution and the broader trick will speak for itself.
]
]&gt;And &lt;5gu8i6$nf$1@nntp2.ba.best.com&gt;:
]&gt;
]&gt;|Oh aren't you wonderful
]&gt;|
]&gt;|You talk the talk but you do not walk the walk.
]&gt;|
]&gt;|You are not on Phil Zimmerman's side.  You are on the side of the
]&gt;|feds.
]
]	Nowadays, I don't think Rich has any side except his own. He
]strikes me as dangerously unstable. Luckily, he only explodes in whining
]rants - so far.
]
]&gt;Please read no further. This is your last warning.
]&gt;
]&gt;OK, I lied. I do that habitually, don't you know. THIS is your last
]&gt;warning.
]
]	Doesn't make it right. Most of the time, you slant and ignore
]contrary evidence. That hasn't worked for you in this thread, so now
]you've escalated. One might also point to the absurdity of posting
]long vitriolic articles and saying "don't read this". It's part of a
]pattern of doing something nasty and vicious and vile, and then
]denying that you're actually doing it.

]&gt;Seth Finkelstein &lt;sethf@mit.edu&gt; wrote:
]&gt;&gt;       This is so ironic given your venom-filled postings. Yes, I am
]&gt;&gt;flaming you back. It's not nearly as fun when the target is defending
]&gt;&gt;themselves, is it? You just can't get away with the mud without consequences.
]&gt;
]&gt;Seth, you weren't the target, though for what you've done with your
]&gt;miscarried "Justice on Campus," you should be. Since you insist, I'll
]&gt;remedy that lack below.
]
]	Umm, you've flamed a lot of people in this thread. And Justice
]on Campus has a lot of contributors, I can't take all credit or blame
]for every part it. I've had a heavy role in some parts of it, and
]deferred in other pieces.
]
]&gt;&gt;&gt;Seth, go to www.dejanews.com. Note that a thread under this title began on
]&gt;&gt;&gt;March 1st. Note that it was a reasonable and civil reply to John Wallace's
]&gt;&gt;&gt;reasonable and civil reply to me. Note that there were several reasonable
]&gt;&gt;&gt;and civil followups. Note that the current topic of this thread did not
]&gt;&gt;&gt;start until March 13th.  Note when you arrived, when the content-free
]&gt;&gt;&gt;flames started, and how I broke off a more reasonable subthread to get
]&gt;&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
]&gt;&gt;
]&gt;&gt;       Wrong. Note that you smeared everyone around in article
]&gt;&gt;id &lt;5g9sin$g5p@quixote.stanford.edu&gt;, that's what started the flame war.
]&gt;
]&gt;Yes, the date on that article is March 13th. There were nine articles in
]&gt;the thread prior to that one. The first post to the thread was March 1st,
]&gt;following up to John Wallace's citation of my name on the so-called
]&gt;fight-censorship list in late February. I was unable to respond to the
]&gt;invocation of my name on the fight-censorship list, so I posted the
]&gt;article here, on March 1st.
]
]	Consider the phrase "Note when you arrived, when the
]content-free flames started ...". I arrived *after* you started the
]flamewar, and your mudfest is what began it. You spit in the thread,
]don't complain it now tastes bad.
]
]&gt;&gt;       This is the sort of rewriting of history Rich does. He posts some
]&gt;&gt;nasty, provocative flames. When people flame him back, he acts so hurt,
]&gt;&gt;and edits out his part in his retelling, playing the wounded innocent.
]&gt;
]&gt;This is, of course, the unalloyed truth.
]
]	We see it demonstrated over and over again. Look at your rewriting
]above.
]
]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     Donna Riley and Jean DeCamp shouldn't be touched with a
]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;10-foot polemic. I met Jean once. The woman couldn't stop berating me
]&gt;&gt;&gt;
]&gt;&gt;&gt;She should have, with the smear campaign you continue to run against her,
]&gt;&gt;
]&gt;&gt;       Her own words condemn her. She'd like to run away from them,
]&gt;&gt;but she can't.
]&gt;
]&gt;I see. How good of you to post selected quotes prominently on the web for
]&gt;more than two years, especially the ones that explicitly read "This is
]&gt;private email" and "Please consider this paragraph confidential."
]&gt;http://joc.mit.edu/footnotes/c3-ljc.txt
]
]	Wrong. All the material is there, has been from early on. Read
]the whole thing, http://joc.mit.edu/charges.html#3 , especially
]http://joc.mit.edu/docs/camp.brief.txt .
]	In fact, I think my first tussle with her was explaining why
]she was utterly wrong to allege "libelous" in that case, a mistake you
]repeated, but you should know better.
]
]&gt;Justice on Campus.
]
]	Take your complaint to all the papers and magazines printing
]Timothy McVay's "confession?" now.
]
]&gt;&gt;&gt;But she didn't take a swing at you, did she? I can only think of one
]&gt;&gt;&gt;person mentioned in this thread who was arrested and convicted for taking
]&gt;&gt;&gt;swings at someone he was living with. "Justice on Campus" they call the
]&gt;&gt;
]&gt;&gt;       Actually, said person was falsely and maliciously accused by
]&gt;&gt;the ex- who has a history of making far-out accusation, on the eve of
]&gt;&gt;their relationship breakup, and couldn't afford to fight it all the
]&gt;&gt;way through (for years?). But talk about one-sided, Rich wouldn't tell
]&gt;&gt;you any of that.
]&gt;
]&gt;Right. I haven't posted the URL for the police report, which mentions
]&gt;third parties Yang and Gardy calling the police when they heard the
]
]	Nor have you mentioned it's hosted by the same person who made
]bogus harassment charges against JOC and me, which where completely
]false and malicious, and has an amazing history of prevarication.
]
]&gt;some concern for personal privacy. I will merely say that in my personal
]&gt;opinion, you are a disgusting individual for allowing yourself to be so used.
]
]	I love you too.
]
]&gt;If you don't think a reasonable and prudent person would read the
]&gt;police report or judgement this way, then by all means, post the URL on
]&gt;"Justice" on Campus. You consider it your duty to post selected personal
]&gt;email between third parties; why not public record?
]
]	I personally believe there's something wrong with it, because
]it's hosted by the very same guy who tried to get JOC and me in trouble
]with manufactured malicious charges. See   http://joc.mit.edu/attack.html
]	If I were dealing with it, I'd put *everything* up in defense,
]but again, I understand at a human level the reaction not to wallow
]though the mud of an angry ex-'s accusations.
]
]&gt;&gt;       You're very mixed up. Bogus harassment charges were filed
]&gt;&gt;against *me*, and it gave me a very good view of CMU-style politics.
]&gt;&gt;They use harassment charges and threats as standard weapons down there.
]&gt;
]&gt;I see. Again, this is the unalloyed truth. "Justice on Campus."
]
]	Rich, exactly what part do you doubt? That charges were made?
]That's never been denied by anyone involved. That they were phony?
]Well, given that I was hundreds of miles away, and I don't think I
]ever sent the guy e-mail, it's hard to make an argument (unless you
]consider Usenet flaming to be sufficient, which I would really advise
]you not to do). So yes, that's the unalloyed truth.
]
]&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes. Two simple wording changes. Please change the name of the list to
]&gt;&gt;&gt;"fight" and change the word "unmoderated" to "moderated."
]&gt;&gt;
]&gt;&gt;       In other words, *SNEER*. It's not about the wording, it's
]&gt;&gt;about your whining, nothing would make you happy, you just want an
]&gt;&gt;issue to cry about.
]&gt;
]&gt;Two simple changes to the wording, in the interest of accuracy. That's all.
]
]	"Lightly moderated with regard to participants" seems very non-sneery,
]but I doubt it'll make you happy.
]
]&gt;&gt;       Explain to me how importing this flame war onto the mailing
]&gt;&gt;list is going to help anything at all. It seems to me it'd just make
]&gt;&gt;things worse.
]&gt;
]&gt;Well, there we disagree. Convene the Happynet Unofficial Anti-Censorship
]&gt;Committee and mull it over at your leisure. I'm in no hurry.
]
]	So tell me how it's going to help anything. At this point, I
]think you're beyond help.
