We Have Over 150 Private Foundations In Our Program All Over the
United States.

WE ARE A FINANCIAL FINDER &amp; MATCHING SERVICE
..."INTEREST - FREE CASH GRANTS - NEVER PAY BACK!"...


FOUNDATIONS CAN BE A BETTER SOURCE FOR FINANCE, THAN BANKS
___________________________________________________________
Foundations give away billions of dollars every year to individuals.
Most are non-profit organizations dedicated to the betterment of
society.  A foundation is exempt  from income tax because of its
non-profit status.  Private foundations have been giving out
cash-grants to people for over 100 years.  You can check with your
attorney or local chamber of commerce.

ARE YOU BEING REJECTED FOR THE MONEY YOU NEED SO BADLY?
_________________________________________________________
Then Why Not Try A Private Foundation? Interest Free Cash Grants From
$500.00 &amp; Up to $25,000.00. No Collateral.  No Cosigners, No Security
Deposit, No Mortgages. No Credit Check.  No Pay Back.

The Money May Be Used For Any Worthwhile Purpose; Business,
Personal, Medical, Real Estate, Education, Religion, Etc.

ANYONE CAN GET AN INTEREST FREE CASH GRANT!
____________________________________________
As long as they have a genuine reason for needing money, &amp; as long as
the foundation guidelines are met.

Dear Applicant,

This letter tells you HOW YOU CAN GET AN INTEREST-FREE CASH GRANT.
Take a few minutes to read it. You'll be suprised  to see how easy it
is to get a grant.  From time to time, everyone needs to borrow.  The
problem is that for most people, getting a loan is a big hassle. Going
to banks or finance companies in person takes a lot of time.  In most
cases, there is endless paperwork.  And Unfortunately, in many cases
all that you end up with is a rejection notice.


ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIT CHECK
________________________
Getting a Grant by mail is probably a lot easier than you think.  In
your area, there are usually only a small number of places that will
provide you with the money, that you need.  On the other hand, there
are literally hundreds of private foundations who donate money to
people who have genuine reasons for needing the money. 

Chances are that most banks in your area have very stringent loan
requirements.  On the other hand, most foundations who give GRANTS BY
MAIL are more lenient.  Persons who have poor credit, no credit, or
even those who have gone through bankruptcy  are able to get the money
that they need - sent to them by a check payable to them. This is
because foundations are NOT interested in CREDIT RATINGS.

GETTING A GRANT BY MAIL IS CONFIDENTIAL
____________________________________
There are no embarrassing interviews.  Neither collateral nor
cosigners are required.  The main requirement is that you have a
legitimate need for the money and are willing to use it for whatever
reason that the foundation agrees to. 

We are not associated with any of the foundations in our program,
therefore all money will go directly to you, payable to you.  As a
Financial Finder &amp; Matching Service, we know where the money is and
which private foundations may be most likely to approve your grant.
There are hundreds of foundations with money to donate.  It is our job
to put you in touch with them.

PLEASE REMEMBER: CASH-GRANTS are FREE of any interest, 
&amp; they DO NOT NEED TO BE PAID BACK!
________________________________________________
Foundations give out money for a wide variety of needs as long as it
is something LEGAL. This means that you obtain the money to pay off
old bills, meet emergency needs, or to buy anything that you might
need, as long as the foundation agrees to it.


YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU WANT TO OBTAIN.  
________________________________________________
The amount can be as little as $500.00, and up to $25,000.00 is
possible.  And remember, there is NO CREDIT CHECK.

As a Financial Finder &amp; Matching Service, we'll review your service
application form and determine which foundations may be most likely to
provide you with the money that you need.  Keep in mind that we have
only reputable foundations in our program.  You are protected by the
fact that these foundations are regulated by the laws of the United
States.

No matter how much you want to obtain, no matter what you want to use
the money for; we feel confident that we can help you to get it with
the service we are offering.
