Organization: Death Camp #6

Several days ago one Robert Hicks, DM Group, Direct Marketing Management, 2774
National Pkwy, Brunswick, Ohio, retained one Thomas Gallman, Telysis
Communications Ltd, to do a mass e-mail for them. Unfortunately, Telesys made
a small typo when sending out their mass e-mail. DM Group's domain address is
"dm1.com" and our domain address is "dm.com" (no digit). That happens a lot,
and not always accidentally. Malcontents like Peter da Silva, Chris Lewis of
BNR.CA, John Gilmore of EFF/Cygnus Support, Ray Arachelian of Earthlink.com,
Sandy Sandfart of C2Net, Peter Vorobieff of LANL.GOV, and other well-known
liars and forgers intentionally forge garbage traffic on the Internet with
their enemies' domain names (including ours) and later complain about their
own forgeries.

I was surprised by Telysis's unintentional error, but I hold no grudge
against them. However as the result of their mass mailing our site has
received hundreds of flames from the self-appointed net.cops, ending up in
mailboxes "postmaster" and "orphan" (sent to a non-existent mailbox
"freeway@dm.com"). Many such flames were also sent to PSI, our upstream site.

I am fairly dissatisfied with the way PSI handled this and other incidents
involving forged traffic made to look like it came from dm.com. Their lines
include "we've been receiving a lot of complaints about you" (and it doesn't
matter whether any complaints are true) and "if you prove that this traffic
did not originate at your site, then we won't hold you responsible" and
"These messages are unwelcome intrusions that violate unwritten rules of the
Internet, and are strongly resented. Please confirm that you are aware of
these complaints and are taking measures to stop this practice."

I also noticed a sharp contrast between the polite letter send out by
dm1.com (who were trying to sell something, I presume; and you don't sell
anything if you're rude to prospective clients) and the obnoxious, obscene,
and threatening responses the net.cops sent to our site. I will quote a
selection of these complaints to illustrate the kind of abuse many ISPs are
subjected to. Please observe that one of the complainers claims to have
received "death threats" from a nonexistent account at our site, several
others claim to have received such junk e-mail from our site before, etc.

If your e-mail to dm.com is quoted below, please consider the following:
If someone sends you junk e-mail, it does not make it OK to send abusive
and threatening e-mail to (what you believe to be) the spammer's ISP.
Please try to use better manners, even when you deal with behavior that
you consider to be rude.

I just sent you a rejection before realizing that YOU have already
spammed me and I have already given you a previous notice (28 January 1997).

Therefore, since you have SPAMMED me again, you have accepted the terms
of my licencing agreement you previously received from me - to wit, each
subsequent use (including this most recent one) are now subject to a
$1000 per-use fee.

You have failed to provide a valid US Postal Address as required by the
licence.  You will immediately provide the address so that I can send you
a bill.

Violation of this license agreement is cause for civil suit.

You are now on notice to immediately comply with the terms of the
licensing agreement.

This user has repeatedly sent me unsolicited advertising, even after
I requested that they stop.   I consider this a clear example of
harrassment and net abuse.

I request that you warn your customer or take the proper
diciplinary action.   This kind of activity (SPAMMING) is extremely
frowned upon by the net in general, and one request to this person
should be enough for them to remove me from their mailing list,
especially since I did not request to be on it in the first place.
Often this will result in the removal of the account in question.

I promised to follow up with this action if they repeated, and so
here it is.

I would apprecate a reply to this email within 1 week.

Sincerely,

Bryce Conner

I don't want any free stuff.

In fact, I'm quite put out that I'm getting this junk.

I'm copying your postmaster on the off chance that it's not you, on the
hopes that you'll get a stern talking to or perhaps even removal from your
service.

Spamming like this is VERY frowned upon.

It appears (as I've now received several of these 'type REMOVE' type
messages) that someone is selling my email address.  I would appreciate, if
that is the case, that you send me their name and/or number and/or email
address so that I can let them know personally my feelings.

I also recommend, if that is indeed the case, that you contact the BBB and
your State Comptroller and see what can be done about capturing the
charlatans.

Good luck with the barrage of nasty messages you're about to receive.

Dear junk email spammer, please REMOVE ME FROM YOUR MAILING LIST
IMMEDIATELY.  I charge for reading unsolicited email advertising.
I did not sign up for this, and I should not have to request to
not be made a victim of this.  I have a limited amout of disk space
available to me, and your junk email is wasting some of it.

By the way, you really need to fix your clock; the current year
is 1997.

POSTMASTER/SYSADMIN: Please archive this notice in case I need
proof that I sent it and it was received at your site.  Thank you.

ACSI.NET         You are the last nameserved host along the route
                 to the originating IP address of this spam.
TELYSIS.COM      You are the originating mail server.
DM.COM (PSI.COM) You are who this spam is supposedly TO; this
                 indicates you are probably being used as a mail list
                 forwarder.
DM1.COM (CLEVER.NET) You are hosting this spammer's web site.

Dear Postmaster,
	On two other occasions I have requested to be removed from
your clients list, yet I am still receiving unsolicited email
advertising from them. This is in direct violation of US CODE TITLE 47
under which I may collect 500 dollars for each occurrence. Please look
into this and get back to me prior to my filing charges against you

Offense under US code Title 47, Sec 227(b) (1) (C)
I have recently received UNSOLICITED and UNWANTED junk e-mail from an
individual who appears to be using your site.  A copy of that mail is
attached herewith.  Junk Mail is now regarded as the same as unwanted and
unsolicited junk faxes and telemarketing calls - all of which are now
ILLEGAL under US federal law:

     By US Code Title 47, Sec.227(a)(2)(B), a computer/modem/printer
     meets the definition of a telephone fax machine. By Sec.227(b)
     (1)(C), it is unlawful to send any unsolicited advertisement to
     such equipment, punishable by action to recover actual monetary
     loss, or $500, whichever is greater, for EACH violation.

Please ensure this is stopped NOW.  You have been put on notice.  If you
confirm to me promptly that effective action has been taken against those
persons responsible, I will not take the matter further on this occasion.

If you do not provide me with such confirmation in a timely manner, or if
ANY further UNSOLICITED or UNWANTED junk mail should be received from your
site, I will instruct my attorney to issue a writ WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE,
and the matter will then be pursued under federal law.  I will separately
notify your upstream providers as they may also be liable for violations
originating from your site.
