Dale, can you set up a mailing list server that will participate in the
distributed listserv network?

thank you

&gt; &gt; Sandy hit a pothole in the moderation experiment when Mr. Nemesis
&gt; &gt; submitted a posting containing nothing but libelous statements about
&gt; &gt; Sandy's employer.  He never anticipated that he wouldn't be able to
&gt; &gt; follow his announced "post it to one list or the other" policy because
&gt; &gt; to do so would make him legally liable (in his opinion; he's a lawyer,
&gt; &gt; I'm not).  His gears jammed, and the whole machine came to a halt for
&gt; &gt; a few days.
&gt; 
&gt; Naturally he hit a pothole.  Censorship has its price, and you
&gt; folks just discovered it.  But censors never give up, do they?
&gt; Especially when there are hidden agendas.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sandy has agreed to continue moderation through the end of the
&gt; &gt; original 1-month experiment (through Feb 19).  And it's a good thing,
&gt; &gt; too, because the "cypherpunks community" had better get off its
&gt; &gt; whining butt in the next ten days, or it will no longer exist.
&gt; 
&gt; John Gilmore is so disrespectful of the human beings on this list
&gt; that he whines and complains about their "attitudes", as though
&gt; he had a right to control them.  What a jerk.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've come to the conclusion that I'm not willing to host the
&gt; &gt; cypherpunks list any more.  It's not the true assholes that brought me
&gt; &gt; to this decision; it's the reaction from the bulk of people on the
&gt; &gt; list: suspicion, flamage, and criticism with every attempt to improve
&gt; &gt; things.  I noticed few people volunteering some of their own time,
&gt; &gt; money, or machines to help out.  Almost all the suggestions were
&gt; &gt; advice for *other* people to implement:
&gt; 
&gt; Not willing because of some additional burden?  No.  It's because you
&gt; were outed as a censor and a jerk, and you can't get back the respect
&gt; you previously had.  The sour grapes you're displaying here are worthy
&gt; of a little child, not an adult.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now each of these posters will get their chance to do it "right" --
&gt; &gt; on their own time and with their own resources.
&gt; 
&gt; Read: I'm gonna take my bat and ball and go home...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A large fraction of the list seems to think that "freedom of speech"
&gt; &gt; means that everyone is required to listen to everyone else at all
&gt; &gt; times.  That there can't be focused, topical conversations in a
&gt; &gt; society that has freedom of speech.  I would say the opposite; part of
&gt; &gt; freedom of speech is the freedom to choose to whom we speak and to
&gt; &gt; whom we listen.  This is part of what cryptography does: lets us
&gt; &gt; control who can receive our speech, and lets recievers determine who
&gt; &gt; the speaker is.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything was fine until you decided to screw it up.  Then your
&gt; emotional, denying little brain trys to blame it on everyone else.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There also seems to be a misunderstanding that freedom of speech
&gt; &gt; requires that people who want to speak already have a place, set up
&gt; &gt; and maintained by someone else, for them to speak in.
&gt; 
&gt; There are places to speak, and people try to speak in those places.
&gt; When they are cut off, then they complain.  Nobody complained before
&gt; you had an open forum that you weren't providing same.  That's your
&gt; denial kicking up, not mine.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If someone
&gt; &gt; who's set up a speech-place decides it isn't being used for its
&gt; &gt; intended purpose, then they are a censor, stopping all possibility of
&gt; &gt; conversations.  Did you forget that there are millions of other places
&gt; &gt; to speak in cyberspace, millions more in realspace, and that you can
&gt; &gt; personally create more if you don't like any of the ones you know about?
&gt; 
&gt; Intended purpose?  Did you really believe that setting up an open
&gt; forum gave you the right (or any option) to control the content?
&gt; Are you so immature that you can't handle complaints?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; To paraphrase Zappa, you wouldn't know censorship if it bit you on the
&gt; &gt; ass.  You think you're being censored when you're just being excluded
&gt; &gt; from a forum because what you're saying isn't interesting to that forum.
&gt; 
&gt; I know a lot of things, especially after they've bit be in the ass.
&gt; Especially about censors and CIA-related trolls like yourself, who
&gt; set up forums to collect info on unsuspecting American citizens.
&gt; Made any "yeti" expeditions lately?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So anyway, I'm tired of it all.  I'd much rather focus on getting my
&gt; &gt; crypto work done than babysitting majordomo, tracking down attempts to
&gt; &gt; subscribe the entire US Congress to the list, and debating the seventy
&gt; &gt; or eighty "obvious right ways" to handle the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Read: I need to find a new troll that's not being sabotaged by
&gt; alert citizens.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is a "put up or shut up" to the cypherpunks community.
&gt; &gt; Either you list denizens will, among yourselves, put in the energy to
&gt; &gt; build a new home for the list (and run it in whatever way your
&gt; &gt; volunteers want) by Feb 20, or the list will cease to exist on Feb 20.
&gt; 
&gt; Jeez, do you have an ego or what?  Who died and made you the king?
&gt; Your only claim to fame is your equipment that's hosting the list.
&gt; Your reputation is in the toilet.  You're nobody.  In fact, you're
&gt; less than nobody.  Your best bet would be to crawl into a hole and
&gt; pull the dirt in over you.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The next ten days of moderated discussion, through the end of the
&gt; &gt; original experiment, will give the community a chance to discuss
&gt; &gt; whether and where it plans to host the list after the experiment is
&gt; &gt; over.  My feeling is that the stalkers who have been trying to shut it
&gt; &gt; down (Dimitri, etc) will be out in full force, trying to disrupt the
&gt; &gt; process of finding a new home.  It would be very hard to make progress
&gt; &gt; along that line in an unmoderated list.  Cypherpunks-unedited readers
&gt; &gt; are welcome to try.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet another accusation that Dimitri's purpose is to "shut it down".
&gt; The very fact that it's you who have the com puts the lie to that.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sandy reports that he's changing his criteria for moderation for the
&gt; &gt; remainder of the experiment.  It was his idea, and I approve.  The
&gt; &gt; criteria now are:
&gt; 
&gt; Another experiment run by the same incompetent bozo who screwed up
&gt; the first experiment.  Don't you clowns ever get it?  You do, but
&gt; then again, you have a hidden agenda.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;         *  The topics of the list are:
&gt; &gt;                 cryptography
&gt; &gt;                 setting up replacements for cypherpunks@toad.com
&gt; &gt;         *  On-topic, legal, posts will go to the list.
&gt; &gt;         *  Postings with any hint of legal liability (in Sandy's opinion)
&gt; &gt;            will be silently ignored.
&gt; &gt;         *  Legal but off-topic posts will go to cypherpunks-flames.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sandy will apply these criteria retroactively to the backlog (of about
&gt; &gt; 140 messages), which means that most recent criticisms of the
&gt; &gt; moderation (which don't invove someone volunteering to do things for
&gt; &gt; the list) will go straight to the flames list.  If you don't like it,
&gt; &gt; I recommend that you start your own list.  Soon.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For me it's a sad thing that the community's willingness to pull
&gt; &gt; together has degenerated to the point where I feel better off
&gt; &gt; separating from the list.  I hope that others in the community will
&gt; &gt; create one or several alternatives that work better.
&gt; 
&gt; So you think you've fulfilled your obligation?  There's only one
&gt; thing that will ever save you.  Get down on your knees and confess,
&gt; saying to God and the list subscribers what a pathetic sinner you
&gt; are, and beg for their forgiveness.  Then get to work for the people,
&gt; and give up trolling for the feds.
&gt;
