&gt;WHO IS BINYAMIN NETANYAHU? (Part One Of Two)

&gt;

&gt;By; Barry Chamish*

&gt;

&gt;Two Fridays after Israel's new Prime Minister was elected, the

&gt;newspapers were filled with bios of the new leader. The most indepth

&gt;research was undertaken by Orly Azula-Katz, Anat Meidan and Rami Tal of

&gt;Yediot Ahronot who produced a balanced portrait and Biranit Goren of

&gt;Kol Ha'ir whose story was a snow job.

&gt;

&gt;Nonetheless, both reports agreed in most details, if not

&gt;interpretations. These two reports, combined with other public

&gt;knowledge create a most disturbing and mysterious caricature of

&gt;Israel's leader for students of secret diplomacy.

&gt;

&gt;The Conventional Story

&gt;

&gt;The prevailing myth about Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is that he

&gt;grew up in a highly politicized, right wing household. Responsibility

&gt;for the presumption lies with his father Bar Tzion, a dedicated

&gt;revisionist who was a pallbearer at the funeral of Zeev Jabotinsky.

&gt;

&gt;The facts are different. Netanyahu recalls," My father did not want me

&gt;to enter politics. We were very non-political." The founding families

&gt;of Zionism's revisionist wing which produced two generations of leaders

&gt;like Menachem and Benny Begin and Yaacov and Dan Meridor, barely knew

&gt;of the Netanyahus.

&gt;

&gt;What Binyamin inherited from his father was an obsession with learning.

&gt;His grades in junior high were all above average but he excelled in

&gt;only one subject: music.

&gt;

&gt;When Binyamin moved to America at age fourteen after his father

&gt;accepted a teaching post in Philadelphia, his hero became JFK.

&gt;Netanyahu felt very alienated being away from Israel and took waitering

&gt;jobs to earn the money to spend his summers back home. There his

&gt;greatest pleasure was working on left-wing kibbutzim with his pals from

&gt;Jerusalem. They recall that he would always try to outwork them, even

&gt;when he had an injured knee.

&gt;

&gt;Returning to high school in Philadelphia, Netanyahu shared close

&gt;friendship with only those students as imbued with love for Israel as

&gt;he was. He was a straight A student who graduated fourth in his class

&gt;at Cheltenham High School, one of the most academically competitive

&gt;schools in America. But he didn't attend his graduation ceremony. War

&gt;broke out on June 5, 1967, and Netanyahu flew to Israel to volunteer

&gt;for the army.

&gt;

&gt;A high school buddy, Ari Bintener recalls,"No one was surprised. It was

&gt;obvious his place was in Israel. I was pleased that he found a way to

&gt;help his country."

&gt;

&gt;Bob Trimble, Netanyahu's soccer coach remembers,"Bibi was the best

&gt;player on the team, except for his brother Yoni who could have played

&gt;professionally if he had wanted to. The only problem with Ben was that

&gt;his political views were so far to the left of the other players."

&gt;

&gt;As a soldier, Binyamin rose to the rank of captain in the most secret

&gt;combat unit of all, the fighting arm of military intelligence. He took

&gt;part in a good number of legendary operations and was wounded while

&gt;fighting highjackers holding a Sabena passenger plane. On the Suez, he

&gt;almost drowned trying to swim with his heavy automatic rifle under

&gt;Egyptian fire. He became known as "the lousy swimmer from Jerusalem."

&gt;

&gt;Soldiers recall him as a cool but "square" officer who lost his temper

&gt;only once. That was when he found his men had been taking "souvenirs"

&gt;from operations in Lebanon. He put a quick end to what he viewed as

&gt;looting.

&gt;

&gt;After five years of soldiering Netanyahu returned to America to study

&gt;architecture at either Harvard or MIT. He chose the latter because it

&gt;permitted him to begin an MA course load, as his academic advisor Prof

&gt;Leon Garviser remembers. "I told him that no one could handle the load

&gt;but he insisted that he had to make up for time lost while serving his

&gt;country. I agreed to add one extra course in the first semester and

&gt;when he passed all his courses I added another one. In the end he

&gt;finished his MA in two and a half years. Don't ask me how. No one did

&gt;it before him or since."

&gt;

&gt;Once again, Netanyahu interrupted his studies only once. In October of

&gt;1973, war broke out in Israel and he flew back to fight in the Sinai.

&gt;When he returned, he became a student activist on behalf of Israel, a

&gt;fact that was noted by the Israeli consul of Boston, Collette Avital.

&gt;In one of the many ironies in his life, it was Avital, the dovish

&gt;consul of New York during the Rabin/Peres administration who arranged

&gt;Netanyahu's first television appearance, a debate with PLO activist

&gt;Prof Edward Said.

&gt;

&gt;The loss of his brother Yoni during the Entebbe raid put a stop to

&gt;Binyamin's plans to become an architect. Instead he settled for an MA

&gt;in business administration and took a post at the Boston Consulting

&gt;Group. His boss was Ira Magaziner, the man who later was the

&gt;intellectual force behind the Clinton administration's failed health

&gt;reform package.

&gt;

&gt;As Moshe Arens notes, "Bibi is only the second prime minister who ever

&gt;had a real job outside the army or politics. Shamir was the first. He

&gt;once worked as an accountant in a glue factory."

&gt;

&gt;While working at Boston Consulting, Binyamin received his first

&gt;diplomatic assignment: he was sent to Sweden to advise the government

&gt;on efficient administration of public companies.

&gt;

&gt;Already earning $100,000 and with a splendid career before him,

&gt;Netanyahu decided to give it all up and return to Israel to act as the

&gt;marketing manager of a furniture concern. As his colleague Barbara

&gt;Maclogan notes,"Anyone who claims Bibi planned to live in America

&gt;doesn't know what he's talking about. He gave up the opportunity of his

&gt;life in Boston to earn a quarter of his salary in Israel."

&gt;

&gt;In 1979, Netanyahu organized an anti-terrorism conference in Jerusalem,

&gt;dedicated to his fallen brother. Somehow, he managed to attract the

&gt;likes of George Bush, George Shultz, and Richard Perle (President's

&gt;Reagan's chief arms negotiator) to the meeting and was thrust briefly

&gt;onto the world stage. But when the conference ended, it was back to

&gt;work at the furniture factory.

&gt;

&gt;That all changed in 1982, when Israel's Washington Ambassador Moshe

&gt;Arens invited Netanyahu to be his deputy. This unprecedented career

&gt;rise has been a subject of much speculation. Many people have noted

&gt;that Bar Tzion Netanyahu was one of the few guests invited to Arens'

&gt;wedding and he was repaying an old friend. But Arens has a different

&gt;explanation. "People got a good laugh when they heard I phoned a

&gt;furniture factory to find a deputy. What sold me on Bibi was his

&gt;organization of the anti-terror conference and the strong impression he

&gt;made on American leaders who participated."

&gt;

&gt;In 1984, after two visibly successful years as Arens' deputy, Bibi was

&gt;named Israel's ambassador to the UN. In another of those ironies that

&gt;follow him, he was appointed to the post by Shimon Peres against the

&gt;objections of Yitzhak Shamir. Once again, it was a leader of the Labour

&gt;Party who promoted his early career.

&gt;

&gt;This was the true turning point in his quest to become prime minister.

&gt;Netanyahu's good looks, fluent English and controversial opinions made

&gt;him a media star. He became a frequent presence on Ted Koppel's

&gt;Nightline and Larry King Live. As King observes,"Whenever he appeared,

&gt;the phones wouldn't stop ringing. He especially made an impression on

&gt;women viewers. As a guest I'd rate him 8. If he had a sense of humor to

&gt;go with everything else, he'd have been a 10."

&gt;

&gt;During this period, Netanyahu wrote his book, Terror-How The West Can

&gt;Win. The book made a tremendous impression on the Reagan

&gt;administration. In fact, whenever George Bush visited New York, and

&gt;that was often, he would call on Netanyahu.

&gt;

&gt;By 1988, Netanyahu had made powerful allies in the American media. He

&gt;received strong support from Charles Krauthammer of the Washington

&gt;Post, Abe Rosenthal of the New York Times, and Ellie Weymouth, daughter

&gt;of Katherine Graham, the publisher of Newsweek. When he returned to

&gt;Israel, he was too powerful a figure to be ignored and was appointed,

&gt;first Deputy Foreign Minister and later the Prime Minister's spokesman.

&gt;In this capacity, CNN made Netanyahu an international media star during

&gt;the Persian Gulf War.

&gt;

&gt;Netanyahu was ready to challenge the Old Guard of the Likud. The

&gt;combination of youth, determination and powerful allies abroad led to a

&gt;resounding victory in the Likud primaries of 1993 and in the general

&gt;elections of 1996.
