# &gt; &gt; &gt; For instance, New Media Laboratories provides no source code for their
# &gt; &gt; &gt; software, nor any type of documentation to track what it 'should' be
# &gt; &gt; &gt; doing vs. what it 'is' doing.
# &gt; &gt;
# &gt; &gt; I had no difficulty obtaining source from them for benchmarking/porting
# &gt; &gt; reasons.  I do freely admit that there is a lack of documentation.

  Let's clear a few things up right off the bat here.  This whole thing
  was done strictly out of complete boredom with the participation
  of a small group of people, mainly online friends.  Needless to say
  it has grown at a seemingly exponential rate, putting us somewhere
  in the ballpark of having a "real shot" at this.

  Source code was initially released on a very early version of the
  RC5-client, after a half dozen or so rogue clients started up, we
  decided to quickly strop distributing source code until the whole
  client-&gt;server protocol could be devised "the right way"..  Source
  code for "current" client will be released as well, hopefully very
  soon now.

  Well documentation for what it is doing?  It's uh, doing some math
  or something; that's retarded.

  Documentation for running?  Well, I suppose anyone unfamiliar with normal
  ``man(1)'' style syntaxing would find it cryptic at best, but it should
  be fairly straight forward.  Now that there actually seems to be extensive
  participation in this, we're doing a FAQ on the website.  Hopefully this
  will alleviate alot of this.

# &gt;   I have had no difficulty in obtaining silence in response to my
# &gt; email regarding New Media Labaoratories and their software.
# &gt;   When I received your post, I was on the verge of deciding that their
# &gt; silence was an indication that they wanted me to consider myself their
# &gt; official spokesperson.
# &gt;   That would have been fun.

  Generally I dont waste my time dealing with such ludicrous issues.  You
  people should all realize, that no matter what you do, no matter how
  you do it, as soon as it hit's mailing lists or newsgroups, someone has
  opinions about it, as well as "a better way of doing it".  Well whatever,
  it's all just a monumental waste of bandwidth.

# &gt; 
# &gt; &gt; &gt; It reports results which are obviously
# &gt; &gt; &gt; in error, and there is no way to divine the source or cause of those
# &gt; &gt; &gt; false results.

  If you are speaking of the website statistics, well I'm not even going
  to get involved in this.  I'm working on "doing it right" as time
  permits.  I didnt have much to do with the one that is up there now.

# &gt; 
# &gt;   However, I am referring to the stats that I get on my own machine after
# &gt; the keys have been 'checked'. I had one message telling me, "Keyspace
# &gt; exhausted in 243.12 minutes." The only problem is that it actually took
# &gt; slightly under an hour. If it is wrong about the time, then how can I
# &gt; be expected to believe that it is right about the keys being checked?

  This is due to the fact that you have a bum client :)  New clients,
  (all compiles are being verified by me before put online) are becomming
  available now.  Proxies for all of the platforms we're supporting will
  be available too; caching proxies underway as well.

  The vast majority of the initial clients were not ported by my me.

# &gt; &gt; A second generation of key serv statistics reporting with wiz-bang
# &gt; &gt; graphics and other cool crap can be expected by the end of this
# &gt; &gt; weekend.

  Uh, terrific.

# &gt; 
# &gt;   This is precisely my point. None of the people that are running these
# &gt; programs on our machines have any way of knowing just exactly what is
# &gt; taking place here.
# &gt; &lt;crap deleted&gt;

  I'm getting more and more distressed about this utter waste of bandwidth
  the further down I get here.

  I will put specifics on how the server assigns keyspace onto the website
  in due time.  Frankly, I do not expect, or care, to be the one to break
  this key.  I in no way, shape or form, give unfair advantages to any
  of the participants.  Keys are assigned, they are not ranked and assigned
  based on any preference whatsoever.  This is pretty ridiculous.

  
# &gt; 
# &gt;   I was impressed with the genx homepage and the number of platforms to
# &gt; which the software had been ported. The software itself was ported to
# &gt; Win95 with at least enough competence to do 'something', as opposed to
# &gt; requiring me to reinvent the wheel in order to get it to run.
# &gt;   But I still don't know what it does, in fact, do, or if I am just
# &gt; pissing in the wind by running it. (Or if it was written by the same
# &gt; guys who killed Kennedy).
# &gt;
# &gt;   So, although I appreciate your efforts, until I find a basis for
# &gt; deciding otherwise, I will be using the Orange Crayola to connect
# &gt; you on my chart to the bad-guys on the X Files.

  The client allows you to participate in the RC5-56 contest (at no unfair
  advantage or disadvantage).  That is the bottom line.  If you wish to
  participate, we'd greatly welcome any instructions you can spare.  If
  you don't, that's fine too, best of luck.
