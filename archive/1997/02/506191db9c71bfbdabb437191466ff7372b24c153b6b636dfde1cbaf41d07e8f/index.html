The provocateurs won.
Too bad.  Seems Cpunks caved to the simplest of attacks.
Proves you don't need key-escrow or any of the rest to 
  ahem, "affect" unfettered discourse in cyberspace.

&gt;A List Goes Down In Flames
&gt;by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)
&gt;February 12, 1997
&gt;   
&gt;       The plan for the cypherpunks mailing list was simple. It was to be
&gt;   an online gathering place, an intellectual mosh pit, dedicated to the
&gt;   free flow of ideas and personal privacy through encryption.
&gt;   
&gt;       Of course it caught on. From its modest beginnings connecting a
&gt;   few friends who lived in Northern California, it quickly grew into one
&gt;   of the most rowdy, volatile lists on the Net: Cypherpunks typically
&gt;   piped more than 100 messages a day into the mailboxes of nearly 2,000
&gt;   subscribers. And the list became a kind of crypto-anarchist utopia.
&gt;   Populated by pseudonymous posters with names like Black Unicorn, it
&gt;   was a corner of cyberspace where PGP signatures and digital cash were
&gt;   the norm -- and there were no rules. Then yesterday came the news: The
&gt;   list was being evicted and faced imminent shutdown.
&gt;   
&gt;       In an e-mail seen 'round the Net, John Gilmore, Electronic
&gt;   Frontier Foundation cofounder and list maintainer, announced that he
&gt;   was no longer willing to provide a virtual home for the cypherpunks.
&gt;   In a post entitled "Put Up or Shut Up," he described how his efforts
&gt;   to improve the list through moderation were condemned, how technical
&gt;   problems were consuming more of his time, how pranksters had tried to
&gt;   subscribe the entire U.S. Congress to the list. How this experiment in
&gt;   crypto-anarchy had failed. He gave the cypherpunks 10 days to find new
&gt;   lodgings.
&gt;   
&gt;       "The last straw for me was seeing the reaction of the list to
&gt;   every attempt to improve it. It was to carp, to cut it down, to say
&gt;   you're doing everything wrong," Gilmore told me yesterday night. One
&gt;   of the first employees of Sun, Gilmore quit after eight years -- a
&gt;   millionaire more interested in pursuing ideas than dollars. But his
&gt;   experiment with the list has left him weary. "If everything I'm doing
&gt;   is wrong, I'm clearly not the right person to host the list," he said.
&gt;   
&gt;       "I would like to see some other structure in which the positive
&gt;   interactions on the list could continue. I'm not trying to create that
&gt;   structure anymore," he added. Instead, he would try the only true
&gt;   crypto-anarchist solution: "I'm handing it over to members to do what
&gt;   they wish with it."
&gt;   
&gt;       The cypherpunks first pierced the public's consciousness when
&gt;   Wired magazine splashed them across the cover of the second issue. The
&gt;   Whole Earth Review and the Village Voice followed soon after. The name
&gt;   "cypherpunk" came to be synonymous with a brash young breed of
&gt;   digerati who were intent on derailing the White House's encryption
&gt;   policies and conquering cyberspace. This was crypto with an attitude.
&gt;   
&gt;       Gilmore was typical of the breed. Monthly Bay Area meetings of the
&gt;   'punks were held in the offices of Cygnus, a company he started to
&gt;   provide support for the free Unix alternative, GNU.
&gt;   
&gt;       But the veteran cypherpunk came under heavy fire in November 1996,
&gt;   when a loudmouthed flamer flooded the list with flame bait and ad
&gt;   hominem attacks on various members. Finally, Gilmore, ironically, gave
&gt;   him the boot -- and incited an all-consuming debate over what the
&gt;   concept of censorship means in a forum devoted to opposing it. In a
&gt;   society of crypto-anarchists, who should make the rules? The mailing
&gt;   list melted down. By last month, it seemed, more messages complained
&gt;   about censorship than discussed crypto.
&gt;   
&gt;       Indeed, for months Gilmore seemed unable to do anything right. He
&gt;   tried moderation, which proved to be even more contentious, raising
&gt;   the question of empowering one cypherpunk to decide what was
&gt;   appropriate for others to read. One member of the group, in effect,
&gt;   would be more equal than the rest. And why would members take the time
&gt;   to write elaborate, thoughtful articles on crypto-politics if their
&gt;   treatises might not make it past the moderator's keyboard?
&gt;   
&gt;       After the expulsion, some of the longtime list denizens left
&gt;   angrily, joining the 700 subscribers who had departed since the
&gt;   controversy began. One of those was Tim C. May, a crusty former Intel
&gt;   engineer who prides himself as the organizer of the first cypherpunk
&gt;   meeting in September 1992. In an essay summarizing the reasons for his
&gt;   departure, he wrote: "The proper solution to bad speech is more
&gt;   speech, not censorship. Censorship just makes opponents of 'speech
&gt;   anarchy' happy -- it affirms their basic belief that censors are
&gt;   needed."
&gt;   
&gt;       After all, May pointed out, the list ended up on Gilmore's
&gt;   toad.com machine only by happenstance -- it almost was housed on a
&gt;   workstation at the University of California at Berkeley. Ownership of
&gt;   the computer with the database of subscribers did not mean that
&gt;   Gilmore owned the cypherpunks. "Whatever our group once was, or still
&gt;   is, is not dependent on having a particular mailing list running on
&gt;   someone's home machine... and it cannot be claimed that any person
&gt;   'owns' the cypherpunks group," May wrote.
&gt;   
&gt;       The cypherpunks have responded to Gilmore's eviction notice. List
&gt;   participants generally have halted the incessant attacks on Gilmore,
&gt;   and now the discussion has turned to how to continue this experiment
&gt;   in online anarchy -- while preventing one person from ever again
&gt;   having absolute control of the List. Within hours of Gilmore's
&gt;   announcement, posters were tossing around ideas of a distributed
&gt;   network of mailing lists that would carry the cypherpunk name, and
&gt;   other 'punks likely will migrate to the more tightly controlled
&gt;   coderpunks and cryptography lists.
&gt;   
&gt;       But for the true believers in crypto-anarchy, only one solution is
&gt;   adequate: Usenet. "There is no 'nexus' of control, no chokepoint, no
&gt;   precedent... for halting distribution of Usenet newsgroups," Tim May
&gt;   wrote. That, in the end, is what defines a cypherpunk.
