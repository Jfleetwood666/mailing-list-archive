Subj: Jon Rappaport's Frauds

Date: 97-01-27 14:29:28 EST

From: alex@mach1.directnet.com (Alex Constantine)



        I want you to know I have no faith whatsoever in Rappaport. His

"book" on the CIA and mind control is actually a file of transcripts

compiled by Valerie Wolf, a New Orleans therapist. Rappaport wrote a

five-page introduction, and he has since claimed ad nauseum that he is the

"author" of the book. He is not. He did not even edit it. The material was

used to advance his own career, and published as is. Yet he still claims he

is the book's "author," and never corrects the many introductions in which

he is credited with having "written" the thing. This is a fraud. His book

on the OK bombing has its own problems, among them a reliance on General

Partin of the Birch Society, discussed in my story on Calspan &amp; McVeigh,

and other dubious sources. This is not to say the book is totally false,

but much of it does not check out. Rappaport also fawns over Bo Gritz. Need

I say more?

Robalini's Note: My sole experiences with Jon Rappaport is interviewing him
on the phone and through my work with Jack Herer and the Hemp Legalization
movement.  Thief or not, Rappaport has a good collection of interesting info
he's written about.  As for General Partin and Bo Gritz, I take their
information for what it is worth, and often it is worth a lot.

Also from big Al:


&gt;&gt;1)  Alex Constantine, in his piece, has, to a degree, implied that McVeigh

is

&gt;&gt;guilty as charged but was brainwashed.

&gt;

&gt;        I said specifically he was "monitored." I don't know if he was

&gt;brainwashed, and neither do you, but there is some evidence to support his

&gt;claim that he was implanted. Other killers in the article were NOT

&gt;brainwashed, and I did NOT "imply" that they were. Sweeny, the killer of

&gt;Allard Lowenstein, was ANGRY, not "brainwashed." The freeway killer in San

&gt;Francisco was NOT brainwashed, but ANGRY. The only brainwashed figure in

&gt;the story was Dan White. McVeigh was ANGRY, not BRAINWASHED.

&gt;

&gt;&gt; Personally, I have some very serious

&gt;&gt;doubts of his guilt, to say the least. I suspect McVeigh, though involved

&gt;&gt;with the people who did the bombing, had no fucking clue what was going
on.

&gt;&gt; In fact, if you check out some other sites (including Tony Sgarlatti's
web

&gt;&gt;page at http://www.future.net/~thetruth/okc.html and the always stupendous

&gt;&gt;Ian Goddard's http://www.erols.com/igoddard/facts.htm) you will soon

discover

&gt;&gt;that the evidence really leans to there being two bombs, and that neither

of

&gt;&gt;them actually came from the truck itself.

&gt;

&gt;        I've talked to Scarlatti. He posted  bogus information, and an

&gt;equally dubious explanation for the bogus information. I know there are

&gt;others involved, and possibly more than one bomb. Your view on the case

&gt;agrees with the militias, who I found to be lying on numerous occasions.

&gt;What I posted was an extract from a much longer story that answers many of

&gt;your questions, and clarifies some of the hazy areas and your

&gt;speculations. McVeigh is no innocent, but your analysis agrees with

&gt;Rappaport, whose book is totally made up of militia postings on the

&gt;Internet.

Robalini's Note: Scarlatti's site, whatever the flaws are to it, is a
mindblower, and should be read for that reason alone.  I may add he's been
very encouraging to The Konformist, and I'm certainly going to burn my
bridges with him.  Still, if you, or anyone else, has any specific criticisms
of his (or other) sites, please let me know and I will forward it.  As for
the militas, well, I've never been into running around in the forest with
guns (though it sounds kind of fun), and I suspect much of that crowd would
hate my guts, but I believe they speak a lot of truth, and that their opinion
needs to be heard.  On the OK Bombing, in particular, they have been
admirable in bringing forth evidence that the corporate media has pretended
doesn't exist.  In fact, if I fault militas members for anything, it is that
they don't go far enough in their condemnation of society, and I think it is
odd that a group which is very much anti-government could fawn over the
military (the most powerful arm of the government) so pathetically.  And,
lets face it, racism and homophobia is quite rampant in the milta crowd (as
it is in the rest of society), so I think there is quite a bit of fraudulence
in many members claims of wanting "less government" and being for "freedom".
 But, hey, if I was going to cut off people who's opinion I disagreed with,
I'd be living in a cave.

Robalini's Note: That's fine by me.  I hope to get some UFO articles and the
like out on this list, for, as I've stated before, I think so far The
Konformist has been a little too politically oriented.  I have been told by
many people that that's a bad idea, that I should stick to this niche, but
screw it, if UFO articles bug you, you can kiss my ass.
