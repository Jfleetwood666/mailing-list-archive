                           "NET DETECTIVE"
                     
                     EASY WAY TO FIND OUT ANYTHING 
                              ABOUT ANYONE
                            ON THE INTERNET
                    (Special Business Owner's  Edition}


                    http://www.servicebrokers.com/DET3.htm


DID YOU KNOW THAT:

With the internet you can discover EVERYTHING you ever wanted to know about
your EMPLOYEES, FRIENDS, RELATIVES, SPOUSE, NEIGHBORS, even your own BOSS!
You can check out ANYONE, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, right on the internet...


The Internet is a HUGE and POWERFUL SOURCE of information, if you
only know WHERE TO LOOK. 

You WOULD be amazed to discover the amount of PERSONAL information
other people can find out about YOU! Or you can find out about THEM.

             *******************************************

                   INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT YOU


Right now,  with just your name and address, I can find out what you do for
a living, name and age of your spouse and children, the make and color of
your car, the value of your home, (and probably how much you paid for it),
credit information, your employment records,  family tree,  military
records, which web sites you visit, etc., etc., etc. I can even find that
long forgotten drug bust you had in college.

AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING, but you get the idea.


                 ******************************************


                              GOOD NEWS


The good news is that now YOU can find the same information, and more, about
almost anyone.

We have compiled a  MAMMOTH  COLLECTION of internet investigative tools that
will provide you with ...

*  Over 210 gigantic internet resources and URLs to locate  people,
credit records, social security, current or past employment,
   mail order purchases, addresses, phone numbers, maps to city    locations...
   
	
	It's truly incredible, the information available...


                  ***********************************

            
                              YOUR COPY

Now, YOU CAN HAVE A COPY  of this gigantic resource.  Here are just a few of
the things you can do with it: 

*  Check out business associates and employees.
	
                                   
* Someone owe you money?  Now you can track them down and find hidden   assets.

* You can locate an old friend, a missing family member, classmate,
   even a lost love.  

*  Find e-mail, telephone or address
   information on anyone! Even look up "unlisted" phone
   numbers!

* Investigate your family history!
   Check birth, death,  or social security records.
   Check service records of Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps.
 
*  Check your own credit reports so you can correct WRONG information
that may be used to deny you credit.
 
*  Trace your FAMILY TREE.

*  Check adoption records.  Find long lost or missing children or    parents.

*  Check out your daughter's new boyfriend!

*  Find trial transcripts and court orders!

*  Find out how much ALIMONY your neighbor is paying.

*  Find EMPLOYMENT opportunities ALL OVER THE WORLD!

*  SCREEN PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES --
   Check their credit, driving or criminal records
   Verify income or educational accomplishments

              
                                 AND

*  You'll even find TIPS to help you "discover" the amount of someone
else's INCOME.

             

                    *********************************

                          WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

You will also discover:

     * How to "CLOAK" your email so your TRUE email address can't be discovered.

     * How to make phone calls through a third party so the number called
doesn't appear on your phone bill.

     * Where to find a list of SPEED TRAPS throughout the USA.

     * How to check out the ETHICS and business practices of businesses
worldwide, including those on the internet.

     * Where you can get SECURITY PRODUCTS such as recording and tracking
equipment, bomb detectors and much more.

     * Information on UNTRACEABLE ASSET protection (anonymous banking) and more

     *  How to locate MILITARY records from Viet Nam, Korea, WW II, etc...

     * How to search LEGAL opinions, trial transcripts, etc...

     *Find Wanted FUGITIVES -- maybe your secretive neighbor!

     *Great for checking out PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES.  EVERY BUSINESS SHOULD
HAVE A COPY!  Allows you to check for driving and criminal records BEFORE
you hire them.


RESEARCH YOURSELF FIRST! You may be astounded at how much data is available
on the internet about YOU, YOUR FAMILY, AND YOUR BUSINESS.

There are THOUSANDS of BUSINESS and PERSONAL USES for these tools.
