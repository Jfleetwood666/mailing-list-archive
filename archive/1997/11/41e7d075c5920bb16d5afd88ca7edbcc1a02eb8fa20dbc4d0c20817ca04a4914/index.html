        "I've never held a job;
        
        "but, I have personally coded more than a few 250,000+ line

&gt;Youe letter show us that you might not be aware of all the facts
&gt;surrounding VME.

    now, let's get several important points straight out front:

    1.  matriculate in a liberal arts program for English grammar 
        and composition; your writing is unintelligible, often 
        contradictory  --no class.

    2.  until you publish the algorithm[s] and the implementation
        code, you do not have a product, you have "vapourware" in
        the encryption business --your trust model reputation
        capital is zero.

    3.  anybody can propose a specification; but over the last
        25 years less than a handful of the hundreds proposed, 
        have been bullet proof --so far; they can still fail.

    4.  a 2^20 keylength is an absurd dimension, more than
        120Kbytes; the efficiency for an average 2K memo is
        less than 2%. just handling the data stream is a load
        on both the processor[s] and the communication link[s].

    if you are still with me...

    1.  I do not believe your claim that you have placed your
        encryption with 250 of the top software companies;
        there are not 250 software companies in the world who 
        could afford your outrageous $1 million base licensing
        be --particularly for what appears to be vapourware.
        Nobody in this business places that level of financial
        commitment on the PASS line in las vegas.  and to pay 
        this fee annually? well, dreams are still permissable;
        but outside of that forum, your hypothesis is a dream.

            corollary: the way to make money is to sell millions
            of licenses at $10, not get down on your knees and
            pray that someone will lay $1 million on you for 
            something which has not been proven in the trenches.

    2.  I do not believe you _ever_ had the $1 million prize 
        money for your alleged contest.

    3.  I do not believe you even have a working model or beta
        release of the software.

    4.  I do not believe you are doing anything other than 
        putting us all on.

    now, if we can get past the above problems for YOU to solve,
    and/or demonstrate the efficacy thereof, to US, the final
    "problem" in your demonstrated inability to communicate can
    be addressed:

    I did NOT ask to participate in your EXPIRED CHALLENGE; that 
    was obviously a farcical expression of egotistical
    tomfoolery or shenanigans --maybe even hooliganism. that
    not withstanding, you never had the money to pay a claim; 
    your ego told you there would never be a claim.

    I DID CHALLENGE YOU to publish your algorithms, source code, 
    and implementations to the group for evaluation. 

        if your hypothesis survives a rigorous exercise and 
        proof of its claims, you will be a hero.

        if your hypothesis, which from this perceptive point
        appears to be vapourware, goes down in flames, you 
        will be no worse a fool than any of the last crop of 
        bulletproof pretenders.

    and that, my friend is living in the real world, not even
    the fast lane.

    the rest of your letter is hokey. ...it's your move.

        attila out...

    ------------ balance of your original drivel follows -----------

&gt;Well, lets start:

&gt;1) The is no "secret" behind the VME flowchart - we have filed with the US
&gt;patent office, and when it's approved, anybody in the world can see the
&gt;flowcharts and diagrams.

&gt;2) We have given a select 250 major software corporations ALL of the
&gt;flowcharts, diagrams and even a WORKING COPY of the VME application.

&gt;3) Why don't we do the same with the general public ? a copule of reasons:

&gt;	a) Due to VME key size (1 million bits) we are forbidden by the US export laws
&gt;to put
&gt;	   it on the Internet, which is a world wide platform (see Paul Zimerman &amp; PGP
&gt;case).
&gt;	b) For the above reasons we can not put any of the flowcharts, diagrams or a
&gt;demo of
&gt;	   of the application without violating the law and getting Big Bro real
&gt;upset.
&gt;	c) VME is currently targeted at the large corporations and a site licensing
&gt;fee is
&gt;	   currently a $1,000,000 annualy, so we have no "General Use" version for
&gt;public use.

&gt;But, as I mentioned before, the top 250 software corporations DO HAVE the
&gt;flowcharts, diagrams and a working copy of VME. Therefore, we do have a team of
&gt;the leading cryptographers working on VME to credit or discredit our claims,
&gt;and that was the challenge all about to begin with.

&gt;Thank you for your interest in VME.

&gt;Saul Backal,
&gt;Project Manager.

p.s. - I've noticed too late of the title to your email - just for your
knowledge, the million dollars challenge have ended May 15,1997 and the
current challenge bear no monetary prize.

Take Care,

Saul.
