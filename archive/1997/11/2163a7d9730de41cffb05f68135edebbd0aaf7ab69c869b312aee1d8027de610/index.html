based on rumor this book is selling extremely well.
why have you not seen it in the mainstream media? answer:
because the mainstream media is secretly controlled.

it is my opinion that we have the government we deserve
based on our total apathy and irresponsibility when it
comes to the political process, speaking as an american.

as slimy and corrupt as Bill is, I think he is just the
first layer of the rotteness and that there are many people
in government who are far more sinister who use him as a pawn
in even more diabolical schemes.

I think we are witnessing a scale of corruption at such
high levels and of such an extent as to have never
before been seen in western civilization.

the big question is whether the american public will wake
up before the next election, or whether nothing
will happen with "business as usual"...

buy this book and help free yourself from the invisible
prison we find ourselves in!!

THE SECRET LIFE OF BILL CLINTON
                           Book Review

By Cathy Leahy

Two hundred years ago Frenchman Alexis  de  Tocqueville  came  to
America  to analyze a fledgling democracy and he left celebrating
her  by  writing  "Democracy  in  America."   Four   years   ago,
Englishman  Ambrose  Evans-Pritchard came with that same hope and
instead has written America's eulogy in "The Secret Life of  Bill
Clinton".  After  reading  this  well written and well documented
book, one might wish  to  rename  it,   "The  Death  of  American
Democracy At The Hands of Bill Clinton."

And if one didn't know the book is about an  American  president,
one  would  think  it describes Hitler, Stalin or better yet, the
(now executed for their crimes) Ceaucescus of Romania.  In  fact,
Evans-Pritchard  warns that under the corruption of Bill Clinton,
"you can sniff the pungent odors of decay in  the  American  body
politic" that was in evidence in continental Europe in the 1920s.

This is a chilling account of  an  emerging  Clinton  pattern  of
lawlessness  with  the  witting  and  unwitting  complicity  of a
complacent establishment that should know  better.  And  although
Evans-Pritchard  doesn't  say  it, he paints a startling parallel
for anyone who has studied history and the rise of Adolf Hitler.

Like Hitler, Clinton used established rules to legally  establish
himself  and quickly went about subverting those same rules. Like
Hitler, once in  office  Clinton  set  about  politicizing  every
government  agency  under  his control, replacing established law
enforcement  with  his  own  loyalists  that  would  silence  his
critics.   Like  Hitler,  he  then  took  control of the press to
further silence  dissent,  although  Clinton  has  done  it  with
seduction  and  lies.   Then,  unencumbered by law, he went about
exterminating his inconvenient associates, two of whom were Vince
Foster  and  Jerry Parks.  That done, he must now create a reason
for people to give up their liberty in favor of safety  with  the
Oklahoma  City  bombing.  Hitler used his henchman to provoke and
help an already irate dissident, Marinus van der Lubbe,  to  burn
the  German  Reichstag  in  1933.  Clinton  used Oklahoma City to
expand his power. If not stopped - and  soon,  what  will  he  do
next?

Evans-Pritchard tells us of the Dixie Mafia and  about  Clinton's
rampant  corruption in Arkansas. He tells us that the Dixie Mafia
is far more dangerous than the Cosa Nostra. Thirty murders  in  a
ten  year period is nothing to Clinton's Dixie Mafia with its one
hundred and fifty.

This  book  is  a  portrait,  with  documentation,  of   American
despotism  that  we  never thought could happen.  Left to his own
devices, Clinton will  put  the  final  nail  in  the  coffin  of
American  democracy. The author does offer some hope, though, but
it will have to come from ordinary citizens who still believe  in
the rule of law.

But if Clinton is tried and convicted for his crimes, will he  be
punished  properly?  Will  he  be  locked  away  along  with  his
accomplices never to be heard from again or will he simply be set
out  to pasture, free to live out his goal of a "one world order"
with himself at the helm?

It's a frightening account but it is a "must  read"  by  we,  the
"ordinary   citizens."    And   although   America's   government
controlled schools will never  allow  it,  this  book  should  be
required reading in every classroom - to save the country.
