If Hettinga was Japanese, the author would be a racist!

&gt; 
&gt; On Wed, 19 Nov 1997 at 11:27:12 -0500 Bob Hettinga had an epileptic
&gt; fit induced by excessive pressure in his swollen head and vomited
&gt; forth:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Tim can make it as "repeatedly clear" as he wants after
&gt; &gt; the fact. However, he has, on several occasions, made
&gt; &gt; threats against people with more guns than he has, and,
&gt; &gt; sooner or later, they're gonna
&gt; 
&gt; Aw, bullshit, Bob! You were wrong when you started this fuckfest
&gt; and you're digging yourself deeper and deeper with every post.
&gt; There was a time when I thought you had a brain and a modicum of
&gt; common sense, but you've thoroughly disabused me of that fantasy.
&gt; I once visited your website and thought, "This guy is cool!"
&gt; Geez, I'm embarrassed to admit that now.
&gt; 
&gt; You've taken Tim's comments out of context and done yeoman work
&gt; for the enemy. If (or when) they ever find an excuse to bother
&gt; him, they won't be showing _his_ posts to the jury -- they'll
&gt; be showing _yours_, you clueless fuckwit.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the age of "social convictions," in case you haven't
&gt; noticed because you've been living in an e-cave. They don't
&gt; prove cases anymore; they show that you're a "bad actor."
&gt; It's all done with PR, whether totally in the press or partly
&gt; in a courtroom. The first piece of paper the feds send out
&gt; when they attack someone is a press release. The victim often
&gt; first learns he's in trouble when the reporters call.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ...lucidity, but who has gotten increasingly radicalized
&gt; &gt; and militant at exactly the same time the world is figuring
&gt; &gt; out that his earlier...
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe you're too young, child. The world is not figuring things
&gt; out fast enough or on a large enough scale to offset the
&gt; accelerating advance of the state. Tim has been around long
&gt; enough to have figured out that the statists have pissed away
&gt; his entire lifetime making him wait for things to get "figured
&gt; out." You have no respect for your elders, who have gotten
&gt; bored over more things than you have yet learned. You should
&gt; be spanked and made to sit in the corner until you can behave.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It's almost as if Tim keeps trying to top himself, with
&gt; &gt; some newer and more grandiose claim about the impending
&gt; &gt; collapse of the world as we know it. It just ain't so.
&gt; &gt; The world don't work that way.
&gt; 
&gt; Tell that to the Athenians and hundreds if not thousands of
&gt; groups since who have been surprised when their worlds
&gt; collapsed. Tell that to the Austrians and Germans of the
&gt; 1920's. Tell that to the piles of bones in Cambodia. You
&gt; suffer from the subjectivity of youth. You think that the
&gt; universe revolves around your time and space and that those
&gt; are unique in human experience. You're wrong. The times into
&gt; which we are headed have every promise of being the very most
&gt; "interesting" in human history. I for one won't feel a bit
&gt; compensated by your future whines that you "wuz wrong!"
&gt; 
&gt; If you had two brain cells to rub together you would have
&gt; taken your lumps in Tim's first brushoff and shut up. He's
&gt; got a right to his position and you haven't got shit. What
&gt; you will have is a place in someone's black book if it turns
&gt; out that your characterizations of Tim's posts ever turn out
&gt; to be fuel for the enemy's meatgrinder. Ignorance, even
&gt; stupidity, are pardonable if not too tightly connected to
&gt; the motor mouth. You should consider that the damage you may
&gt; do could far exceed the value of whatever pride it is that
&gt; impels you to continue to articulate the government's ideal
&gt; (and fatuous) arguments in this matter.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And, Monty, here's another fact: the world isn't going to
&gt; &gt; end on Thanksgiving Day, much less at the beginning of the
&gt; &gt; millennium.
&gt; 
&gt; Only a complete fool would be that sure.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Armed storm troopers are probably *not* going to decend
&gt; &gt; on the denizens of this list and haul them off to newly
&gt; &gt; built gulags in the Rockies somewhere, or whatever the
&gt; &gt; current fantasy of the moment is.
&gt; 
&gt; Really, if you just stopped and thought about it a moment,
&gt; there are only a very few regular posters to the list. All
&gt; of them could be hauled off without making a ripple. We are
&gt; meanwhile playing war footsie with Iraq after having spent
&gt; the better part of five years doing Clinton's best to
&gt; disable, demoralize, cripple, and mismanage the military.
&gt; We're a few press conferences away from being in way over
&gt; our heads with a left-wing android in charge. Is this your
&gt; picture of stable times and a secure Constitution? Do you
&gt; seriously doubt that there are people in the Administration,
&gt; at least in the bureaucracy, who wouldn't like to be able to
&gt; make a few gratuitous PR linkages in a national emergency
&gt; and have an excuse to get rid of the C-P annoyance once and
&gt; for all? Did you miss entirely the personal destruction
&gt; wreaked on Jim Bell _without_ a national emergency? Would you
&gt; be utterly shocked to learn some day soon that you, too, have
&gt; ordered odd chemicals from someplace or other over the last
&gt; few years? Hey! It could _happen_!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, to say that they're coming to take us all away
&gt; &gt; on Thanksgiving, or anytime soon, is more than a little
&gt; &gt; paranoid, and,
&gt; 
&gt; No, Grasshopper, it is just a _little_ paranoid to suggest
&gt; that it might be a possibility. You're putting words in
&gt; Tim's mouth again. You can probably assume that if Tim
&gt; were really convinced that that were going to happen, they
&gt; would find only an inflatable Tim sitting in front of a
&gt; 'puter relaying email through an indirect dial link. Or
&gt; something like that. He's just concerned. I'm concerned.
&gt; Anyone with a brain above room temperature is concerned.
&gt; Ugly things are in the wind.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; to attempt to force a confrontation in hopes of
&gt; &gt; preciptating a revolution, or even gratuitous publicity
&gt; 
&gt; Why, Grasshopper! He's done no such thing and you well know it.
&gt; You are the one making such characterizations (as if any of
&gt; us needed that). Had I the time and the interest, I would
&gt; check what archives there are to see if you did the same
&gt; favor for Jim Bell.  Fuckwit!
&gt; 
&gt; Well, there's more, but your time's up. See you in the camps.
