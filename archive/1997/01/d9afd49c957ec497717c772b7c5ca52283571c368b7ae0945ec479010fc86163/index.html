&gt; Non-White Immigration: Death Sentence for America
&gt; 
&gt; by Dr. William L. Pierce 
&gt; Chairman, National Alliance 
&gt; 
&gt; TODAY WE'LL TAKE A LOOK into the future -- a look into what the future
&gt; will be like if we all remain spectators and simply let the present
&gt; course of events continue. 
&gt; 
&gt; And we'll also look at what the future could be if we choose to become
&gt; participants in the historical process instead of merely remaining
&gt; spectators. 
&gt; 
&gt; I will tailor these two visions of the future especially for those of us
&gt; who live in North America -- but in broad outline they will be
&gt; recognizable by all of us, no matter what part of the White world we
&gt; live in. 
&gt; 
&gt; First, let's look at the future we will have if we continue behaving
&gt; just as we are now: if we continue watching TV, paying our taxes, and
&gt; letting the politicians and the controlled media run the country. 
&gt; 
&gt; Consider demographics, for example: the relative numbers of the
&gt; different types of people in America. During the 50 years since the
&gt; Second World War, America has been darkening, has been getting less and
&gt; less White. Immigration from Europe was cut off after the war -- except
&gt; for Jews, of course -- and the floodgates from the non-White world were
&gt; opened. Asians and mestizos have been pouring into the country, both
&gt; legally and illegally. 
&gt; 
&gt; Most of these non-White races breed much faster than Whites do. The
&gt; result has been a steady rise in the percentage of non-White minorities
&gt; in America. If you live on a farm in Kansas or the Dakotas you may not
&gt; have noticed the change. If you live in Florida or California or New
&gt; York, however, you certainly have noticed it. In fact, most of our
&gt; people who live in America's larger cities have had their faces rubbed
&gt; in it. 
&gt; 
&gt; If things continue as they are going now, there is no chance at all that
&gt; this situation will become better. Non-White immigrants will continue
&gt; pouring into America, because no matter how bad things get here,
&gt; conditions will be even worse where these immigrants came from. The
&gt; government will not even try to halt the illegal part of this non-White
&gt; flood, because the government doesn't really want it halted. And the
&gt; non-Whites already here will continue to have more children than the
&gt; Whites. At some time in the next century Whites will become a minority
&gt; in North America. And the flood will continue. 
&gt; 
&gt; And the television propaganda telling us that the flood of non-Whites
&gt; really is a good thing will continue too. The politicians will
&gt; continue to sing the praises of "diversity" and "multiculturalism," in
&gt; tune with the television. We will be told that if we object to
&gt; the flood we are "haters" and "racists." Interracial sex will continue
&gt; to be presented as fashionable by the media. And what was
&gt; a White country 50 years ago will gradually become a Brown country. 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, even a hundred years from now there may be a few super-rich
&gt; White families who will be able to keep their heads above the flood on
&gt; their own private islands, with their private security forces, but for
&gt; the rest of us there will be no White schools, no White neighborhoods,
&gt; no White clubs or bars or restaurants. We will be submerged: that is,
&gt; our grandchildren will be submerged. That's the way it has been planned,
&gt; and that is the way it will happen -- not may happen, but will happen --
&gt; if we don't interfere: if we just keep watching TV, paying our taxes,
&gt; and voting for the Democrats or the Republicans. 
&gt; 
&gt; Right now I can almost hear the hoots and groans from a million or so
&gt; Politically Correct idiots. "What difference does it make whether
&gt; America is White or Brown?" they are saying. "What difference does it
&gt; make what color our grandchildren are? Color is only skin deep. After
&gt; all, we're all the same; we're all equal." Or, if they're onto the very
&gt; latest Politically Correct fad, they are saying, "There really is no
&gt; such thing as race. Scientists have proved that race is just an illusion
&gt; created by racists to keep us all apart." 
&gt; 
&gt; Really, there is no fad too foolish or too perverse, no opinion too
&gt; contrary to the facts, for these Politically Correct lemmings to
&gt; adopt, once it has been declared fashionable by the controlled media.
&gt; But certainly the lemmings will have their way -- if the rest of us do
&gt; nothing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Or consider crime. The lemmings would have us believe that crime is the
&gt; result of "oppression" and "injustice" by heterosexual White males, and
&gt; that it will disappear as soon as we have a society where no one is
&gt; "discriminated against" and where all of the officially favored
&gt; minorities are given everything they want. I don't think that even the
&gt; lemmings really believe that, but that's what the television has taught
&gt; them to say, and so that's what they say. 
&gt; 
&gt; You and I, on the other hand, understand that as we have given the
&gt; minorities more and more handouts, as we have given them every sort of
&gt; advantage over ourselves -- all sorts of affirmative action preferences
&gt; in admissions to universities and professional schools, in the granting
&gt; of financial aid, in hiring and promotions -- crime has become worse and
&gt; worse. Passing laws requiring us to favor them and prohibiting us from
&gt; discriminating against them in any way has made their behavior steadily
&gt; worse -- not better. 
&gt; 
&gt; It used to be that nearly all crimes committed by Blacks were against
&gt; other Blacks. They knew that if they attacked a White person they would
&gt; be severely punished, and besides, segregation kept them pretty much
&gt; among themselves and didn't give them many opportunities for mischief.
&gt; Now we've taught them that they don't have to fear us or respect us. The
&gt; controlled media have persuaded them that we have oppressed and
&gt; persecuted them and that whatever they do to us serves us right. 
&gt; 
&gt; You know and I know that the crime situation can only become worse in
&gt; the future, if for no other reason than that the number of Blacks and
&gt; other minorities will continue growing. We have only to look to the
&gt; continent of Africa in order to see our own future. Before Europeans
&gt; came to Africa, the Blacks there were eating each other, literally, just
&gt; like the other animals. We outlawed cannibalism among the Blacks, and
&gt; for more than 300 years we tried to teach them the ways of civilization. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then after the Second World War, in a spasm of lunatic egalitarianism,
&gt; we turned our colonies in Africa over to the indigenous Blacks and left
&gt; them to their own devices: no oppression, no persecution, every
&gt; advantage for success. 
&gt; 
&gt; And what happened? The Blacks reverted to their jungle behavior almost
&gt; as soon as we had left. Even in South Africa, which until very recently
&gt; was a civilized, White country, the jungle is reasserting itself. The
&gt; financial capital, Johannesburg, which a couple of years ago was as safe
&gt; and clean as any city in Europe, has become so crime-ridden since the
&gt; handing over of the country to Black rule that its streets are now among
&gt; the most dangerous in the world, with armed Black gangs prowling in
&gt; search of prey by day as well as by night. It may be another 30 or 40
&gt; years before conditions in South Africa resemble those in Rwanda or
&gt; Uganda, but that's exactly where they're headed. 
&gt; 
&gt; And it may take more than 100 years for America to get there, but that's
&gt; where we're headed too. There is a fundamental law of Nature which also
&gt; applies to the historical process. It is the law of entropy. It tells us
&gt; that if we have a highly developed civilization in one part of the world
&gt; and a jungle society in another part of the world, and we place those
&gt; two societies in contact and let the inhabitants of the jungle society
&gt; take a hand in the running of things, the civilization which used to be
&gt; highly developed will soon take on the characteristics of the jungle
&gt; society. Ordered societies become disordered, except where the
&gt; genius for order remains in firm control. The tendency is always toward
&gt; decay, toward dissolution, toward chaos and ruin -- except in those rare
&gt; instances where the vital spark is able to assert itself. When that
&gt; spark is quenched or overwhelmed, decay inevitably sets in. 
&gt; 
&gt; The vital spark I'm talking about, the genius for order, the spirit of
&gt; progress which built our civilization, is European. Of course, Europeans
&gt; aren't the only race with a vital spark. Every people has its own
&gt; variety of organizational genius. The Japanese have theirs, the Chinese
&gt; have theirs, and so on. Actually, every form of life has a peculiar
&gt; genius for organizing the non-living matter in its environment into
&gt; living matter. That's true of worms and viruses, of fish and horses. In
&gt; each case, however, the genius takes a unique form, the spark burns with
&gt; a different brightness. In Black Africa the spark of civilization always
&gt; has been very, very dim. Among our people it has been very bright. Our
&gt; government now, however, under the influence of the controlled
&gt; mass media, is pursuing policies which are guaranteed to extinguish our
&gt; spark, policies which are guaranteed to bring our level of civilization
&gt; down to that in Rwanda or Haiti -- not next year, or even in the next
&gt; decade, but eventually. 
&gt; 
&gt; Haiti is a good example of the law of entropy. In the 18th century Haiti
&gt; was the jewel among the European colonies in the New World. It was clean
&gt; and green and prosperous. It was civilized. It had an efficient
&gt; government, thriving industry and commerce, and law and order. It was a
&gt; French island, a European island. Then came the egalitarian lunacy, the
&gt; sheer democratic madness, of the French Revolution, which declared Black
&gt; slaves and White masters equal. The consequence of this was that the
&gt; French with foresight left Haiti, and the Blacks, having been persuaded
&gt; that they were just as capable as Frenchmen, massacred the rest, hoping
&gt; to have Haiti's riches entirely for themselves. What happened instead,
&gt; of course, was that Haiti's civilization declined within a few years
&gt; from the European level to the African level, and it has remained there
&gt; ever since, despite the fact that the United States Marines went in and
&gt; rebuilt Haiti's entire physical infrastructure and reorganized its
&gt; political system earlier in this century. As soon as the White Marines
&gt; left, in 1934, the Black genius for crime, squalor, and disorder
&gt; asserted itself again. So that's our future, if we just sit back and
&gt; watch: more and more non-Whites, more and more crime and filth and
&gt; disorder, and eventually, a century or two from now, another Haiti on
&gt; the mainland. 
&gt; 
&gt; But we don't have to just sit back and watch. We know how to avoid that
&gt; dismal path of decay and ruin. We know how to solve every problem
&gt; necessary to get us back onto the upward path again. 
&gt; 
&gt; Consider illegal immigration, for example, which is responsible for so
&gt; much of the darkening of America. The government and the controlled
&gt; media pretend that illegal immigration is an insoluble problem. They
&gt; show us on television all the holes which Mexicans have cut in the
&gt; border fence, they show us groups of Mexicans wading across the Rio
&gt; Grande, they show us Mexicans climbing over the fence and running
&gt; through the traffic in San Diego to evade our Border Patrol, and they
&gt; wring their hands and tell us that it's just impossible to stop illegal
&gt; immigration. The government says it's assigning another 100 Border
&gt; Patrol agents in one place and it's building a stronger fence in another
&gt; place, but then the Mexicans just come across some other part of the
&gt; border. The government acts like it just doesn't know what to do, that
&gt; it's just too big a problem, that it would take too much money to solve. 
&gt; 
&gt; But really, that's all just a game calculated to fool the American
&gt; people. The government knows perfectly well how to stop illegal
&gt; immigration, but it doesn't want to stop it. The government just wants
&gt; to make us believe that it's trying its best. But, you know, any of you
&gt; listeners who've had any military experience understand that illegal
&gt; immigration can be stopped easily, quickly, and permanently. Even I,
&gt; who've never been in the Army, can guarantee you that if I were in
&gt; charge of the border between the United States and Mexico I could
&gt; completely halt illegal immigration within 24 hours, and I could keep it
&gt; completely halted with far less expense than that now required to
&gt; operate our Border Patrol. All I would do is authorize Border Patrol
&gt; agents to shoot anyone attempting to cross the border illegally. Two or
&gt; three shootings in the first night, in each sector of the border where
&gt; crossings are frequent, and the word would be out: "Don't try to cross
&gt; the border, unless you want to die."After that, I would spend a couple
&gt; of months erecting a simple fence from San Diego, California, to
&gt; Brownsville, Texas. I'd erect it in two rows 100 feet apart, with mines
&gt; and electronic sensors planted between the rows. I'd have jeep patrols
&gt; along our side of the fence, patrolling at unpredictable times, but with
&gt; never more than an hour between patrols, and I'd have helicopters
&gt; patrolling above. I'd do it all with a permanent Border Patrol force
&gt; along the Mexican border of 5,000 men, and no illegal immigrants would
&gt; get through. None. 
&gt; 
&gt; The lemmings, of course, would be screaming that I am bloodthirsty, that
&gt; I am a murderer, and so on, but really, fewer Mexicans would have to be
&gt; shot trying to come across the border that first night than law-abiding
&gt; Americans are now being murdered each year by illegal-alien criminals in
&gt; California and Texas. 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess we all tend to be a bit selective in our sympathies. I have
&gt; sympathy for my own people, for the victims of Mexican criminals, and
&gt; the lemmings have sympathy for the criminals. They're Politically
&gt; Correct, and I'm Politically Incorrect. But I would stop illegal
&gt; immigration, painlessly and cleanly, and they prefer to believe that it
&gt; can't be done. 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem of the illegal aliens already in America also can be solved.
&gt; So can the race problem. These problems are more difficult and will
&gt; require a much larger effort than the problem of illegal immigration,
&gt; but the cost of solving them now is infinitesimal compared to the
&gt; long-term cost of failing to solve them. All we need to solve these
&gt; problems is the will to survive as a people, the will to build the basis
&gt; for a progressive future for our kind, the will to avoid ending up like
&gt; Haiti or Rwanda a couple of centuries hence. 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, we all know that one thing couch potatoes don't have is will.
&gt; People who've been raised on television, who've grown up with a
&gt; spectator's attitude toward the world around them, certainly aren't
&gt; going to stir themselves just to ensure a future for their
&gt; grandchildren. Instead, they're just going to reach for the potato chips
&gt; and keep on watching. Spectators don't count. The people who do count
&gt; are in two relatively small groups. In one group are you and I and the
&gt; others who care enough about the future of our people to do something
&gt; about it: in fact, to do whatever it takes. 
&gt; 
&gt; In the other group are the people who control the mass media, plus their
&gt; collaborators in the government, in the mainstream churches, in the
&gt; universities, in finance and industry, and in the other institutions of
&gt; our society. 
&gt; 
&gt; You know who controls the mass media. Many of you also know why they
&gt; don't want the problem of illegal immigration and the other problems
&gt; threatening our future to be solved. They are Jews, and throughout their
&gt; whole history they have lived by two principles: first, always be loyal
&gt; to your fellow Jews; and second, always remember that anyone who is not
&gt; a Jew is your enemy; never forget and never forgive. 
&gt; 
&gt; Their collaborators in the government and other institutions are
&gt; individuals who have no sense of loyalty to our people and who have a
&gt; vested interest in following the lead of the Jews. Some of them are
&gt; office holders who understand that they hold their offices at the
&gt; pleasure of those who control the mass media, those who control public
&gt; opinion, those who control votes. Most of these collaborators have no
&gt; sense of responsibility to anyone but themselves. 
&gt; 
&gt; Typical of these is a man who is a friend of an acquaintance of mine; he
&gt; is an assistant district attorney in New York City, a man who
&gt; understands what's going on but who doesn't really care. When challenged
&gt; to take a stand for his own people, he said: "Look. Everyone around here
&gt; knows that the Jews are running the government. It's too bad, but
&gt; there's nothing we can do about it. I've got to look out for myself. I
&gt; have a career and a family to think about. If I want to get ahead, I
&gt; have to collaborate." 
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, there are many, many others among our people who have no
&gt; more sense of personal honor or responsibility than this New York City
&gt; assistant prosecutor. It is a great shame for us. We really need to
&gt; purge ourselves of this shame some day. 
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, we can take some comfort in the knowledge that such people,
&gt; who have no loyalty to anyone but themselves, are always ready to switch
&gt; sides as soon as they see the tide turning. The tide is not yet turning
&gt; -- at least, not enough for people like that assistant district attorney
&gt; in New York to notice. The swarm of Brown immigrants from Mexico is
&gt; still growing from week to week, and our government is still making only
&gt; the most transparent pretense of trying to stop them. The couch
&gt; potatoes are as passive as ever, and the Politically Correct lemmings
&gt; are as idiotic as ever. 
&gt; 
&gt; Changes are beginning to take place, however. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our weekly radio programs are reaching more and more people. People who
&gt; hear us telling the truth are emboldened to tell the truth themselves. 
&gt; 
&gt; The ripples of truth are spreading. Soon those ripples will become
