&gt; Yeah, Greg, we all hate those pesky asshole-types.  But what do you do,

I dug up a few Sandy e-mails from my archives. Does the prospective moderator's
propensity to describe his enemies' words as "logical fallacy" and "illogical
claptrap" remind you of one paranoid anonymous control freak who used to spell
his stupid nym in lowercase and then flamed me when I quoted it verbatim?

]&gt; &gt; &gt; You are confused. The above question was e-mailed to me by one of
]&gt; &gt; &gt; Timmy May's friends.
]&gt; &gt;
]&gt; &gt; What you were doing was confusing... how about attributing what people
]&gt; &gt; have said to you, in the standard way?  I was unsure what was going on
]&gt; &gt; until you clarified here.  Instead of including all the headers in
]&gt; &gt; there with just a space between your headers and the quoted headers
]&gt; &gt; (which makes it hard to follow, and makes one wonder if someone is
]&gt; &gt; trying a crude forgery), use standard quoting conventions:
]&gt; &gt;
]&gt; &gt; 	Joe Blogss &lt;joe@bloggs.com&gt; writes in private email:
]&gt; &gt; 	&gt; [quoted message body]...
]&gt; &gt;
]&gt; &gt; or similar?
]&gt;
]&gt; You're right - the forwarding mechanism I've been using so far just yanks in
]&gt; the spam e-mail without any processing. I will henceforth
]&gt;  1) Put the words 'Tim', 'May', and 'spam' in the subject line
]&gt;  2) Put some obvious ASCII prefix in front of the quotes.
]&gt; I apologize for any confusion.
]&gt;
]&gt; &gt; &gt; If you have any comments about Timmy May's friends not knowing
]&gt; &gt; &gt; English, trying to insult people, and posting non-crypto-relevant
]&gt; &gt; &gt; political rants, address them to Timmy May and his friends.
]&gt; &gt;
]&gt; &gt; It would seem to me that the first insults were thrown by yourself,
]&gt; &gt; and that your strange habit of bouncing all the fallout to the list is
]&gt; &gt; perpetuating the problem.
]&gt;
]&gt; No. Let me remind you the sequence of events, in chronological order:
]&gt;
]&gt; 1. Timmy May (who picked up a few popular PKC buzzwords, doesn't know
]&gt; anything about crypto, and isn't interested in learning) started spamming
]&gt; this mailing list with political rants
]&gt;
]&gt; 2. Most people who used to discuss crypto work on this mailing list
]&gt; have unsubscribed.
]&gt;
]&gt; 3. I pointed out a few examples of Tim making factually bogus claims in
]&gt; his rants.
]&gt;
]&gt; 4. Tim got very angry at me and started flaming me. I ignored him.
]&gt;
]&gt; 5. Tim posted a series of rants about me, attributing to me various
]&gt; nonsense I never said. I pointed out once that I never said it and
]&gt; then ignored him.
]&gt;
]&gt; 6. Recently it came to my attention that Tim's been contacting off-list
]&gt; various people in the computer security field and "complaining" about
]&gt; the politically incorrect things that I supposedly say on the Internet
]&gt; - except that he made up most of the "things" he complained about.
]&gt;
]&gt; 7. At this point I pointed out quite publicly that he's a liar.
]&gt;
]&gt; 8. Since that time, several friends of Tim May (or maybe Tim himself,
]&gt; using multiple accounts) have been sending me harrassing e-mail, often
]&gt; by quoting my own cypherpunks articles and adding an obscenity.
]&gt;
]&gt; 9. Tim himself continues flaming me and telling lies about me (see his
]&gt; recent rant with the subject "death threats").
]&gt;
]&gt; And you see, Timmy May is an obsessive liar and a vindictive nutcase.
]&gt;
]&gt; &gt; If reporting to the list is accurate, I hear you have a PhD with a
]&gt; &gt; subject related to crypto, so presumably you would have ample
]&gt; &gt; knowledge to contribute technical crypto related thoughts.  I'm sure
]&gt; &gt; people would be interested in anything along those lines you cared to
]&gt; &gt; contribute, and your reputation would benefit,
]&gt;
]&gt; I still hope to be able discuss crypto on this mailing list (yes, my Ph.D.
]&gt; thesis was about crypto), but I see two problems:
]&gt;
]&gt; 1. A lot of people have already left this list, unwilling to be subjected
]&gt; to Tim May's rants, lies, and personal attacks. If I post something crypto-
]&gt; relevant to this mailing list, they won't see it.
]&gt;
]&gt; 2. Here's an example of the net-abuse being perpetrated by Tim May and his
]&gt; merry gang of mailbombers. I posted some crypto-relevant wire clippings
]&gt; to this mailing list. Either Tim (using an alternate account) or some pal
]&gt; of his e-mailed it back to me with an obscenity appended.
