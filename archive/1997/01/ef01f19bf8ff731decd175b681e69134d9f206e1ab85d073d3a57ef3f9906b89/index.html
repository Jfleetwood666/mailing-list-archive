Hi,

PRESS RELEASE:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

THIS IS URGENT--TWO U.S. BASED INTERNATIONAL GIANTS MERGE
FOR A GROUND FLOOR OPPORTUNITY. THIS WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT
EMAIL OF YOUR MLM LIFE.

Two major publicly traded giants have joined forces to harness new
telecommunications technology which promises to alter the way the
world communicates.  Until now, calls had to be transmitted through
hard wire, fiber optics, or expensive land-based relay stations.
Within months, all this will change.  According to industry experts,
calls in certain closely guarded test markets are already being made
directly from phone to phone via satellite.

Distance is no longer a factor.  Without the considerable costs of
hard wire installation, maintenance, and major overheads.  With this
new technology, rates are predicted to fall as much as 50% and more.
This means that a direct dial call from Sydney Australia to London,
Tokyo, or anywhere else in the world, might well be less than ten
cents per minute.  Calls within any country should also be reduced
well below any currently being offered by any existing provider.
Each user will only need a portable "little black box" which contains
all the electronics to instantly convert any telephone into a two-way
satellite transmitter.  According to industry spokesman, the clarity
of the voice link significantly exceeds present standards and the
technology applies to fixed based phones as well as cellular units.

Although the two major participating companies have requested
anonymity until the official announcement in a few weeks time, it has
been revealed that each is the industry leader in its respective field
with combined annual sales exceeding Eighty Billion Dollars.

This Technology will be made available throughout the world as
quickly as the new company can cope with anticipated demand.
Pre-Launch requests are now being accepted from interested parties
that will enable them to move to the top of the list to receive
information on a priority basis as soon as it becomes available.

In an unexpected announcement, the company has revealed its desire to
introduce this technology through network marketing.  To maintain an
orderly marketplace, the number of Pre-Launch distributors has been
severely limited.  If you are interested in being placed on the priority
list to receive additional information about the new service or wish to
be involved in the world wide marketing, please send the form below
in any of the three manners listed.

and all forms and instructions will be dropped into your email box
in moments.  There is NO COST or obligation in taking this first step.
You make the final decision only after receiving all the relevant
information.
