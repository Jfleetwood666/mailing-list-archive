STATUS OF THE BILL (updated 7/6/94)

The Cantwell bill, that allows for fewer restrictions exports of
cryptography, has an interesting history.  It was rolled into the 
General Export Administration Act HR 3937.  The House Foreign Affairs
Committee passed the full strength version out of committee after
open, public hearings.  The House Intelligence Committee took the
bill and gutted it after a day of closed, secret hearings.  The
gutted version is making its way to the House floor.

There is a crucial stop-off point, however.  The House Rules Committee
planned to hold a hearing on 6/30/94 to determine if the bill can be
amended on the House floor (an "open" bill) or not (a "closed" bill).

*** The vote was put off, because in one member's words, "all the legislators
*** went home early".  This gives us more time to lobby!

If they mark the bill as "open", then the Cantwell bill could be restored
to its previous version, removing the language put in by the House Select
Intelligence Committee which gutted it without a public hearing.

YOUR LOBBYING HAS ALREADY WORKED!  A constituent reported back to me
that their legislator (Rep. Quillen) had taken a position on marking
the bill as "open".  In a land where legislators are loathe to offend,
this is terrific!  Call and urge your legislator to take a position
in favor of "open"!

This may be the last thing you can do for the cryptographic export
legislation.  Take the time to make a call!

Chronology of the bill
Jul 11, 94  House Rules Comm. reconvenes; possibly votes again this week
Jun 30, 94  [*** vote postponed, perhaps till the week of 7/11/94]
	    House Rules Comm. decides whether to allow amendments
	    on the bill when it reaches the House floor 
Jun 14, 94  Gutted by the House Select Committee on Intelligence 
May 20, 94  Referred to the House Select Committee on Intelligence 
May 18, 94  Passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on May 18
	    attached to HR 3937, the General Export Administration Act
Dec  6, 93  Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade and
Nov 22, 93  Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

Estimated time to do this good deed: Two minutes

Show your support for HR 3937 (formerly HR 3627) by contacting a member
of the House Rules Committee and ask them to mark the bill as "open"
(allowing amendments) when it reaches the House floor.

The phone numbers of the members of the House Rules Committee are listed 
below.  Please pick one from your state and call them.  If your state
isn't listed please call the Chairman, Rep. Joe Moakley.
 
Feel free to use the following sample communique:

The Honorable ____________
address
Washington DC, 20515

Dear Congressman or Congresswoman,

Please mark the General Export Administration Act (HR 3937) as 
"open" (allowing amendments on the House floor).

Recently the House Intelligence Committee removed several provisions
of the General Export Administration Act, HR 3937, dealing with
the export of cryptographic technology.

The House Intelligence Committee did this in a closed, secret hearing
which provided for no public input.  The House Foreign Affairs
Committee previously held an open hearing on the same issue and
received a flood of people testifying in favor of the bill, which the
committee then reported out in full.

I urge you to allow the democratic process to take its course
on the House floor and mark the bill as "open".

Sincerely,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the Cantwell bill?

The Cantwell bill would permit companies to export products with
encryption technology in them.  US companies are currently
not permitted to export products (hardware or software) with this
technology in them.


What is encryption technology?

Encryption technology, or cryptography, is the art of scrambling 
a conversation so that only the people communicating can decode
it.  Other people (such as eavesdroppers) cannot learn about
the conversation.


Where is cryptography being used?

Cryptography is used to encrypt electronic mail to protect its confidentiality
in transit.  It's used by bank automatic teller machines to protect
sensitive data (such as your account number, your Personal Identification
Number, and your bank balance).  It can be implemented into software
(such as electronic mail programs and word processors) as well as hardware
(such as telephones and "walkie-talkies") to ensure your privacy.


Why is there a restriction on exporting products with technology
in them?

For many years the United States was a leading researcher in
cryptography.  High quality cryptographic technology was available only
within the United States.  The US government thought that if they did
not let this technology be exported, foreign individuals would not be able
to obtain it and use it against us (by keeping US intelligence agencies
from eavesdropping on their communications)

Since then, cryptography research has been published in international
journals.  Companies have been created throughout the world who
export cryptographic technology from countries that do not have
these restrictions.  You can now buy the same, high-quality cryptographic
technology from many international firms.  Although the marketplace
has changed, the regulations have not.


Why should the regulations be changed?

US companies compete in a global marketplace.  Because of the export
regulations, they often compete alongside products with superior
cryptographic capabilities built into them.

The result is that US companies build their products with
an inferior encryption technology.  The result of this is that
you, as an American consumer, have great difficulty obtaining
products with strong encryption in them.

Because US products cannot compete against products with better 
privacy features, and because the laws are outdated, the regulations
should be changed.  The Cantwell bill fixes these regulations to more
accurately resemble the current situation of the world marketplace.


How can I help encourage more privacy-enhanced products and
pass the Cantwell bill?

Call or write your representative and ask them to support or cosponsor
Rep. Cantwell's export provisions (formerly HR 3627) in the General
Export Administration Act, HR 3937.  You can base your letter on the
sample communication below.


SAMPLE LETTER OR PHONE CALL

The Honorable ____________
address
Washington DC, 20515

Dear Congressman or Congresswoman,

As a citizen concerned for my privacy, as well as a supporter of
American business, I urge you to cosponsor the Rep. Cantwell's
cryptographic export provisions (formerly HR 3627) in the General
Export Administration Act, HR 3937.

The bill would allow US companies to produce and export products with
cryptographic privacy-enhancing technology in them.  These products
are already available from firms throughout the world.  US companies
lose nearly $100 million per year in exports to them.

By encouraging this industry, ordinary citizens like you and me would
be able to purchase products with better privacy features.

Please support or co-sponsor HR 3937.

Sincerely,

___________________________________
