&gt;	interesting but idle question hit me: what ever happened to RC1, RC3,
&gt;	MD1, MD3, A1, A2, A4, A6, and A7?

&gt;Any reason why you left out A5 above? :-) ...

I left it out simple because it is a known cipher.  All of the ciphers mentioned
above are parts of series, but I have never seen published mention of them
(eg. we know MD2, MD4 and MD5, but those very numbers imply the existance of
MD1 and MD3, which I have never seen any reference to.)  I left A3 and A8
out as well.

&gt;This is *significantly* more of a coup on the net that the NSA handbook.

Definitely, although the algorithm description posted was not complete.
What is clear, though, is that the French-designed A5 cipher is hideously
insecure (unless there is some amazing subtlty to it's design, and I
very much doubt it).

Some implications:

1. The French - with their well-known and legislated hatred of civilian
   crypto - won the battle of the GSM crypto algorithm, and managed to
   corrupt any chance of the incorporation of decent security in this
   mobile protocol.  The French position has had wide reaching implications
   globally, which I suspect that a lot of people would not be too happy
   about.

2. That our governments lied to us about the security of the algorithm.
   I note with some disgust that Australian organisations like ASIO and the
   AFP pushed HARD for A5X over A5 on the grounds that A5 was too hard
   to break.  This position was a fabrication, that much is clear.

3. That GSM phones are NOT in any way secure.  Sure, it's better than AMPS,
   but that is not saying much.  I also wonder if the embargo on the
   release of the A5 algorithm was simply to enforce the monopoly of
   the government SIGINT operations.

Anyway, let's throw this discussion open.  Here is the algorithm description,
and don't forget that A3 and A8 probably came from the same guys, and they're
part of GSM's key exchange protocol.  If they're as good as A5, GSM is in deep,
deep trouble security-wise.

BTW, the algorithm leaked, it was not reverse engineered.  I do not expect
SKIPJACK to leak, as it's distribution would be VERY limited, even within
the NSA and chip houses.  Even A5 was reputed to be known to only 2 or 3
people within Motorola.

I do not have a description of A5X, but I have heard rumors that A5 generates
a single 114 bit key, and then continues to use it over and over again.
As all of you would realise, this would be utterly trivial to break.

&gt;Subject: A5 (Was: HACKING DIGITAL PHONES)
&gt;Date: 17 Jun 1994 13:43:28 GMT
&gt;Organization: U of Cambridge Computer Lab, UK
&gt;Message-ID: &lt;2ts9a0$95r@lyra.csx.cam.ac.uk&gt;

The GSM encryption algorithm, A5, is not much good. Its effective key length is
at most five bytes; and anyone with the time and energy to look for faster attacks
can find source code for it at the bottom of this post.

The politics of all this is bizarre. Readers may recall that there was a fuss 
last year about whether GSM phones could be exported to the Middle East; the 
official line then was that A5 was too good for the likes of Saddam Hussein.

However, a couple of weeks ago, they switched from saying that A5 was too strong 
to disclose, to saying that it was too weak to disclose! The government line now 
pleads that discussing it might harm export sales. 

Maybe all the fuss was just a ploy to get Saddam to buy A5 chips on the black 
market; but Occam's razor suggests that we are really seeing the results of 
the usual blundering, infighting and incompetence of bloated government 
departments. 

Indeed, my spies inform me that there was a terrific row between the NATO signals 
agencies in the mid 1980's over whether GSM encryption should be strong or not. 
The Germans said it should be, as they shared a long border with the Evil Empire; 
but the other countries didn't feel this way. and the algorithm as now fielded is 
a French design.

A5 is a stream cipher, and the keystream is the xor of three clock controlled
registers. The clock control of each register is that register's own middle bit, 
xor'ed with a threshold function of the middle bits of all three registers (ie if
two or more of the middle bits are 1, then invert each of these bits; otherwise 
just use them as they are). The register lengths are 19, 22 and 23, and all the 
feedback polynomials are sparse.

Readers will note that there is a trivial 2^40 attack (guess the contents of
registers 1 and 2, work out register 3 from the keystream, and then step on to
check whether the guess was right). 2^40 trial encryptions could take weeks on a 
workstation, but the low gate count of the algorithm means that a Xilinx chip can 
easily be programmed to do keysearch, and an A5 cracker might have a few dozen of 
these running at maybe 2 keys per microsecond each. Of course, if all you want to 
do is break the Royal Family's keys for sale to News International, then software 
would do fine.

It is thus clear that A5 should be free of all export controls, just like CDMF 
and the 40-bit versions of RC2 and RC4.

Indeed, there seems to be an even faster attack. As the clock control is stop-go 
rather than 1-2, one would expect some kind of correlation attack to be possible, 
and on June 3rd, Dr Simon Shepherd of Bradford University was due to present an 
attack on A5 to an IEE colloquium in London. However, his talk was spiked at the 
last minute by GCHQ, and all we know about his attack is:

(a) that sparse matrix techniques are used to reconstruct the initial state
    (this was published as a `trailer' in the April 93 `Mobile Europe');

(b) that he used some of the tricks from my paper `Solving a class of stream 
    ciphers' (Cryptologia XIV no 3 [July 90] pp 285 - 288) and from the follow-up 
    paper `Divide and conquer attacks on certain classes of stream ciphers' by 
    Ed Dawson and Andy Clark (Cryptologia XVIII no 1 [Jan 94] pp 25 - 40) (he
    mentioned this to me on the phone).

I believe that we have to stand up for academic freedom, and I hope that placing 
A5 in the public domain will lead to the embargo on Simon's paper being lifted.

APPENDIX - AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A5

The documentation we have, which arrived anonymously in two brown envelopes, is 
incomplete; we do not know the feedback taps of registers 2 and 3, but we do know 
from the chip's gate count that they have at most 6 feedback taps between them.

The following implementation of A5 is due to Mike Roe &lt;mrr@cl.cam.ac.uk&gt;, and
all comments and queries should be sent to him.



/*
 * In writing this program, I've had to guess a few pices of information:
 *
 * 1. Which bits of the key are loaded into which bits of the shift register
 * 2. Which order the frame sequence number is shifted into the SR (MSB
 *    first or LSB first)
 * 3. The position of the feedback taps on R2 and R3 (R1 is known).
 * 4. The position of the clock control taps. These are on the `middle' one, 
 *    I've assumed to be 9 on R1, 11 on R2, 11 on R3.
 */

/*
 * Look at the `middle' stage of each of the 3 shift registers.
 * Either 0, 1, 2 or 3 of these 3 taps will be set high.
 * If 0 or 1 or one of them are high, return true. This will cause each of the
 * middle taps to be inverted before being used as a clock control. In all
 * cases either 2 or 3 of the clock enable lines will be active. Thus, at least
 * two shift registers change on every clock-tick and the system never becomes
 * stuck.
