some also support Usenet posting.  Soda is pretty typical.

- The cypherpunks remailers, which are mostly one-way no-reply mailers;
- Various enhanced cypherpunks remailers, which have features like
encrypted reply addresses you can attach at the end.

You can get information on using the soda remailer by sending email
to remailer@csua.berkeley.edu, with "help" somewhere in the posting;
I'm not sure if it wants it in the Subject: or in the body.
That's the remailer that posts from "Tommy the Tourist" with
random NSA-bait at the bottom of postings.

Here's a recent posting on getting status of remailers.
Note that some really only remail once per day, so they may be
working fine even if it says they're not.

Hi all,

   I have written and installed a remailer pinging script which
collects detailed information about remailer features and reliability.

   To use it, just finger remailer-list@kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu

   There is also a Web version of the same information, at
http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html

   Please do not take the uptime figures too seriously, at least for
another week or so. The script has only been running reliably for a
few days.

   Please let me know about any other remailers which I missed. I've
only included remailers which can mail to arbitrary addresses, so I
already know chop and twwells are missing.

   If you've got a Web page, please feel free to include a link to
this page. If you think your Web page is relevant to the subject of
remailers, let me know and I'll link it in.

   Comments and suggestions welcome!

coming soon, PGP hits the mainstream:


   PGP: Pretty Good Privacy
   by Simson Garfinkel
   1st Edition November 1994 (est.)
   250 pages (est),ISBN: 1-56592-098-8, $17.95 (est)

     PGP is a freely available encryption program that protects the
privacy of files and electronic mail.  It uses powerful public key
cryptography and works on virtually every platform.  PGP: Pretty Good
Privacy by Simson Garfinkel is both a readable technical users guide and
a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at cryptography and privacy.  Part I
of the book describes how to use PGP:  protecting files and email,
creating and using keys, signing messages, certifying and distributing
keys, and using key servers.  Part II provides background on cryptography,
battles against public key patents and U.S. government export restrictions,
and other aspects of the ongoing public debates about privacy and free
speech.

Foreword by Philip Zimmermann

This book is about Pretty Good Privacy, a program I created to encrypt e-
mail using public key cryptography. PGP was electronically published as
free software in 1991. Little did I realize what this project would lead to.
PGP has become the worldwide de facto standard for e-mail encryption.
        I've admired Bill Stallings's writings in computer science for some
years before PGP, and here he is writing a book about my program. How
can I talk about how great his book is, without, by implication, talking
about how great PGP is? It's hard to write a foreword for his book about
PGP without sliding into some measure of self-indulgence.
        I've been so close to this project for so long that I sometimes lose
sight of the scope of what PGP provides. I got the manuscript for Bill's book
in the mail the other day -- the book you are holding. Sitting down with it,
flipping through it, endless pages of diagrams, the formal treatment of it,
services provided by PGP. It wasn't till I saw his book on PGP that I could
step back and see PGP as others see it. The breadth of it. As a software
engineer, I'm used to either documenting my own software, or having a
random company tech writer document it. All software engineers get that.
But having William Stallings do the manual for your software -- it's sort of
like having your portrait done by a world-class artist.
        There are a very small number of software packages that have far-
reaching political implications. Most software that fits in such an influential
category has negative effects on our civil liberties. For example,
government intelligence agencies use a software package called PROMIS,
which is a powerful tool of governments to track people's activities,
movements, spending, political affiliations, et cetera. Now that is a piece of
software with far-reaching political implications. Mostly bad ones. Then
there is the software that the Medical Information Bureau uses to classify
people who file medical insurance claims, to put them on a medical "black
list", so that they cannot purchase any medical insurance ever again. That
software has far-reaching political implications -- enough to raise a large-
scale backlash in our society to do something about it. In most cases, it
seems that software that has powerful political effects is software designed
to strengthen the strong and weaken the weak.
        But PGP also has far-reaching political implications. Mostly good ones.
In the Information Age, cryptography affects the power relationship
between government and its people. The Government knows this all too
well, as evidenced by their recent policy initiatives for the Clipper chip,
which would give the Government a back door into all our private
communications -- an Orwellian "wiretap chip" built into all our
telephones, fax machines and computer networks. PGP strikes a blow
against such dark trends, and has become a crystal nucleus for the growth
of the Crypto Revolution, a new political movement for privacy and civil
liberties in the Information Age.  This government has done all they can to
stop the emergence of a worldwide encryption standard that they don't
have a back door into. And that same government has placed me under
criminal investigation for unleashing this free software on the world. If
indicted and convicted, I would face 41 to 51 months in a federal prison.
        Despite the pressure the Government has brought to bear against
PGP (or perhaps because of it), PGP has become the most widely used
software in the world for e-mail encryption, used by a variety of activists,
and anyone else needing protection from the powerful. It's also used by
ordinary people to protect their personal and business communications
from prying eyes.
        PGP may have a future as an official Internet standard, as the
Internet Engineering Task Force develops an interest in it. No one who
wants to work in the area of Internet e-mail privacy should neglect
studying PGP. Because of the "fax machine effect", more people who want
to encrypt their e-mail are getting PGP because everyone else who
encrypts their e-mail is already using it.
        Naturally, I want people to read the Official PGP User's Guide, which
comes with the electronic distribution package of PGP (also in book form
from MIT Press), because I wrote it. Also, I'm more entertaining and
personable in my book. And more political. But Bill Stallings' book is more
comprehensive than mine, more thorough, covering more detail, with a lot
more diagrams. He's really good at completely nailing it down in a book. In
fact, I'll probably use his book myself as my preferred reference to PGP.

Subject: IRC Encryption

There was a thread a while back about encrypted conversations on channel
#freedom on irc. I came across the software I believe they are using. Its
a package called Circ, and it is available from archives of
comp.sources.misc volume 38 issue 10. It is interesting in that it uses
RSA for key exchange, and triple DES for the encryption. The Circ package
includes an earlier implementation "socks" which is a stand alone
encrypted irc client. I think this is what they use on #freedom. This is
an interesting tool for a couple of reasons. irc can be as anonymous as
you want to make it. There are ways of hiding what site you're coming
from, your real username, you can change your nick often as you want, and
it's got a high enough usage that you can lose yourself in a crowd.
It supports background file transfers. You can create a channel and lock
it to uninvited people. It is supported pretty much net-wide, if you can
telnet, you can irc. Interesting stuff, and I'll be playing more with it
in the near future.

BTW: my nick is cryptical on irc. :)
