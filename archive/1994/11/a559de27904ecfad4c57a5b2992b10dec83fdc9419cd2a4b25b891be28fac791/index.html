Chapter 1. PGP general.

PGP is Pretty Good Privacy from Phil Zimmermann. It is currently the
best available encryption available to civilians at large.
Zimmermann is the programmer on the original PGP versions but now,
apparently, just guides other programmers in making improved versions.
PGP uses two encryption algorithms: RSA for its Public Key powers &amp;
IDEA for its bulk encryption. The advantages of PGP over other
crypt/decrypt systems are:
1. RSA algorithm. Allows users to communicate without needing a secure
channel to exchange keys. - PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION.
2. The program system has been very well done &amp; has huge development
support.
3. It has huge popularity.
4. Security is guaranteed with distribution of source code &amp; public
investigation.
5. Its free.
6. Both RSA &amp; IDEA are "STRONG" algorithms.



Section 2: Michael Johnson's PGP FAQ contribution

Michael Paul Johnson &lt;mpj@netcom.com&gt; has an excellent faq on
Subject: Where to Get the Latest PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) FAQ
/* (Last modified: 31 October 1994 by Mike Johnson) */

 You can get this faq by anonymous ftp to:
ftp.csn.net /mpj/getpgp.asc

It is also posted monthly on alt.security.pgp

   The latest versions of PGP are VIACRYPT PGP 2.7 , MIT PGP 2.6.2
&amp; PGP 2.6ui &amp; the new PGP 2.6.i . Which is best? I would say
MIT PGP 2.6.2 although PGP 2.6.i is a close contender. MIT's has
source code, Phil Zimmerman's blessing &amp; is US legal. For a further
discussion of variations, consult Michael Johnson's FAQ.

Section 3. Stealth PGP                                                   37

   Stealth PGP refers to a PGP file that does not have the
RSA prefix tag on the beginning of a PGP encrypted file or to PGP
utility software that disguises this tag. Possibly, a later version
of PGP with have this as an option.

   The advantages of "Stealthy" PGP are that its files  cannot be found
by Internet search programs that hunt for the PGP/RSA tag &amp; that a
"Stealthy" file may be more securely hidden by a good steganography
program.

From: Mark Grant &lt;mark@unicorn.com&gt;
Subject: Stealth PGP

Responding to my question "Has Stealth PGP been done yet?"
Mark Grant says:

Kind of, there's a 'stealth' filter available that strips and attaches
headers to PGP messages after encryption. It's available from various
places, and the documentation is available on my 'other people's PGP
addons' WWW page :

        http://www.c2.org/~mark/pgp/other.html

There's also information about Privtool, my PGP-aware mail program for
Sun workstations at :

Steganography is the craft of hiding messages in pictures. The text is,
of course, encrypted text rather than plain text.


The current best steganography program has been done by Arsen Arachelian
Below, follows his text contribution:


From: rarachel@prism.poly.edu (Arsen Ray Arachelian)

WNSTORM is available from:
ftp.wimsey.bc.ca:/pub/crypto/software/dist/US_or_Canada_only_XXXXXXX/Steg

Usual routine to get it. i.e. cd /pub/crypto/software, get the README
file, and if you agree to the terms then follow the instructions.

Short description off the top of my head (I wrote the beastie)  Another
info scrap should be in the same directory as WNSTORM.


WNSTORM is a data encryption/steganography utility which is pretty secure for
most uses.  Unlike some stego systems WNSTORM is expandible, all you have to
do is write your own LSB injector/extractor for whatever data format you wish
to hide information into.

WNSTORM doesn't require the recipient of the host picture, sound, movie, etc.
to have the original un-stormed picture.  Unlike primitive stego programs,
WNSTORM doesn't compare an stormed picture with an unstormed picture.

WNSTORM will cover its tracks statistically.  If it changes a 0 bit in the
LSB data stream to a zero, or a 1 bit to a 1, it does nothing.  If it changes
a 1 bit to a zero, it will balance itself by changing an unused adjacent 0
bit to a 1.  Ditto for a 0-&gt;1 transform.

WNSTORM will NOT change every bit of the LSB in order to prevent detection.
It will use a passkey along with a probabilistic algorithm to decide which
bits it will change.  The algorithm for picking bits depends on the previous
succesfully encoded/decoded cyphertext AND the passkey.

Internally WNSTORM works by picking "windows" or "packets" of bytes out of
either a random number stream or an LSB stream extracted from a picture,
sound, movie, etc.  It then injects eight bits of cyphertext into this window.
Each window is of variable size.  The bit locations where the bits are inserted
are randomly exchanged for each pass.  The bit values are also randomly
exchanged for each pass.

WNSTORM includes an injector/extractor for PCX images, however I will write
more injecotr/extractor programs for it in the future, and OTHERS can do so
as well.

Announcing PGP WinFront 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A freeware Windows front end for PGP 2.3a and 2.6
Copyright 1994 Ross Barclay (rbarclay@trentu.ca)

WHAT IT IS:

        - PGP WinFront is the most fully featured free (or
        otherwise) Windows front end available. It will make
        using PGP easy for beginners, and it will drastically
        increase the speed at which experts use it too.

        PGP WinFront is now into is third revision and I have
        tried to implement as many of the suggestions that I
        received as possible. PGP WinFront was designed by
        its users, but was coded by me.

        Features:

        - Supports secret key ring placement on floppy drive
        - Support en/decryption to/from clipboard

        This program does too much to list here. And it's free!

        This version is a complete rewrite of the popular
        PGP WinFront 2.0. The feature-set has largely been
        set by users who sent in suggestions.

        Please read the file README.TXT and peruse the help
        files. Please send me your comments.

HOW TO GET IT:

        At the moment, there are 2 ways to get this program:

        1) Via FTP

        - The PGP WinFront 3.0 filename is called PWF30.ZIP.

        - It has been uploaded to the incoming directories of
        the following FTP sites:

                ftp.cica.indiana.edu
                ftp.eff.org
                ftp.wimsey.bc.ca
/* from Gary Jeffers. There has been a problem getting pwf30 from these
sites. However, it CAN ACTUALLY be ftp'ed with the following info.:



ftp.wimsey.bc.ca:
/pub/crypto/software/dist/US_or_Canada_only_XXXXXXXX/PGP/Misc/pwf30.zip
*/

                soda.berkeley.edu
                ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
                ftp.ee.und.ac.za
                ftp.demon.co.uk

        - Hopefully, they will be slotted into the PGP directories
        soon. On CICA, it will be placed into \pub\pc\win3\utils.
        That is where PWF20.ZIP was placed.

        - Once you get the program, please upload it to other
        FTP sites!

        2) From Colorado Catacombs BBS

        - dial (303)772-1062. The file is called PWF30.ZIP

        - once you get the program, please upload it to other
        BBSs.

        *** The mail access system I had was discontinued. This is
        because the file was too big to fit into my account.
        However, you can still register PWF and request certain
        PGP and PWF related items using my mail access system.
        Details of these are on the "About" screen of PWF 30.

The latest release of PGP For Windows is in

        ftp.netcom.com:/pub/ecarp/pgpwind.zip

Several bug fixes, and an occasional feature or two :)  Now you can set the
font for the program if you don't like the default. ;)

Thanks to Dave Merriman and D. Morgan for beta testing.

The next release will hopefully have online help for the program itself, even
though it's pretty straightforward.  Comments, bug reports to me.  Thanks!

Section 2. Viruses sources.


          AMERICAN EAGLE PUBLICATIONS

Cypherpunks,
   I have found a source of info. that I just must share!

American Eagle Publications, Inc.
P. O. Box 41401
Tucson, AZ 85717

   I'm sure they will send you a catalog just for the asking.

   So, what are they about? They are about VIRUSES! They don't just
carry a couple of virus things - they are the VIRUSES-ARE-US of the
virus world! They have a journal: Computer Virus Developments Quarterly.
They have books on viruses, virus protection, cryptanalysis, the science
fiction book "Heiland", a CD-ROM for $99.95 of several thousand live
viruses, disks of viruses with source code, executable &amp; utilities,
programs &amp; cards for boot protection, &amp; even a virus IDEA computer
system protector.

   Copy follows for two items of particular interest to Cypherpunks:

POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, KOH
 By the "King of Hearts"
   A sophisticated piece of software which uses ideas first developed by
computer virus writers to secure your computer system against those who
would like to get their hands on the information in it. You give KOH a
pass phrase, &amp; it uses state of the art IDEA data encryption algorithm
to encrypt all of the information on your hard disk &amp; your floppies. It
is, for all intents &amp; purposes, unbreakable, &amp; works well with DOS &amp;
Windows. Many encryption programs offered commercially are easily
cracked, but this one is not.
   Some people call this program a virus, come say it is not. In ways,
it acts like a virus to do some of your security housekeeping for you.
Yet at worst it is a friendly virus that lets you choose when &amp; how
it will replicate.
   program &amp; manual on disk, $10
program, full source, &amp; manual on disk, $20
(Overseas customers add $12: KOH cannot be exported from the US, but
since it was not developed in the US, we will forward your order to the
overseas distributor. Please allow 6 weeks for delivery)


HEILAND
By Franklin Sanders
276 pages, Paperback, 1986

   Here's an entertaining book about America in the year 2020. If you
wonder if it's proper to use viruses in wartime or if such a virus could
be termed "good", this book will give you some food for thought. Sanders
makes use of computer "worms" when the oppressed people of the US attack
the federal government in an all-out war against tyranny. Sanders uses
his worms right too - not as some all-powerful monster. Rather, they are
deployed as part of a larger military strategy. For a book written in
1986, that's not bad!
   And if you're fed up with the government, this book is sure to give
you a vision for the future. Sanders has been part of the mounting tax
protest in this country. He's fought the IRS in court for years &amp; won
some important battles. Unfortunately the government seems to be con-
firming some of his worst suspensions about them. Now you can get a good
dose of his philosophy &amp; his ideas about remedying our problems. And if
you work for the government, don't be offended - this book is doubly
recommended for you!
Book, $8.00

for shipping add $2 per book. 5% sales tax for AZ. residents.

   It is my belief that in the next few years more uses for viruses
than just being a vandal will be found. Also, they may find a place
in protecting our electronic freedom. - for instance virus remailers.
Also see my previous post - The FREEDOM DEAMON. Also, they have a place
in my CHATTERBOX concept(a remailer for chat mode or commands).
"Viruses aren't just for Sociopaths anymore!"
   Also, I suspect the state may start cracking down on virus tech-
nology. Incidentally, did you all know that crypt has a place in modern
viruses? Encryption is used to hide "nasty" code &amp; virus signatures
until they get into the system &amp; decrypt.
                                         Yours Truly,
                                         Gary Jeffers

                                         PUSH EM BACK!  PUSH EM BACK!
                                         WWWAAAYYY  BBBAAACCCKK!
