&gt; Subject: Perry Nomination Brief
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Subject:  Remarks by President Bill Clinton and Deputy Secretary
&gt; of Defense William J. Perry upon the announcement of Dr. Perry's
&gt; Nomination as Secretary of Defense --
&gt; Conducted at the White House on Monday, January 24, 1994, at
&gt; 3:00 p.m.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      President Clinton:  Thank you very much, and good afternoon.
&gt; I want to welcome all of you here, especially the distinguished
&gt; members of Congress who are here, and the members of Secretary
&gt; Perry's family who he will introduced later.
&gt; 
&gt;      One year ago I selected Dr. Bill Perry to serve as my Deputy
&gt; Secretary of Defense.  Today, based on his lifetime of
&gt; accomplishment and his solid leadership at the Pentagon, I'm
&gt; proud to announce my intention to nominate him as the next
&gt; Secretary of Defense.  He has the right skills and management
&gt; experience for the job.  He has the right vision for the job.  He
&gt; has served with real distinction as both Under Secretary and
&gt; Deputy Secretary of Defense.  For years, and throughout his
&gt; service this past year, he has been at the cutting edge on
&gt; defense issues.
&gt; 
&gt;      Years ago he had a vision of the power of stealth technology
&gt; -- technology that helped the United States win the Persian Gulf
&gt; War, and helped save American lives.  He's been a leader in
&gt; reforming the Pentagon's procurement process and improving
&gt; financial accountability.  I expect he'll have more to say about
&gt; that today and in the weeks and months ahead.
&gt; 
&gt;      He's been instrumental in developing a defense budget for
&gt; the coming fiscal year that protects the readiness of our forces
&gt; and promotes our aggressive efforts at defense conversion, and
&gt; the development of dual-use technologies, and the creation and
&gt; the preservation of American jobs.  He played an important role
&gt; in the recent breakthrough to eliminate Ukraine's nuclear
&gt; weapons.
&gt; 
&gt;      He brings a broad and valuable background to this job.  He
&gt; has proven experienced in the private sector.  He's the chairman,
&gt; director, and founder of several successful defense-related
&gt; corporations.  He's served in the United States Army.  His
&gt; academic career as a professor of mathematics and engineering has
&gt; also contributed to our nation's security.
&gt; 
&gt;      In every aspect of his work, Bill Perry has earned high
&gt; respect from members of both parties.  In the Congress and the
&gt; military, among those who study military strategy, and in the
&gt; business community.  He's demonstrated leadership, integrity, and
&gt; a mastery of his field.  Time and again we heard about him and
&gt; what I have come to know personally -- Bill Perry is a real pro.
&gt; You can depend on him.  That's why Secretary Aspin and many
&gt; others recommended that I select Dr. Perry for this post.
&gt; 
&gt;      Let me note, with appreciation that Secretary Aspin has
&gt; agreed to stay, as he said he would, until his successor is
&gt; confirmed.
&gt; 
&gt;      Now we have a lot of work ahead of us.  We need to continue
&gt; reshaping our forces for this new era so that they remain the
&gt; best trained, the best equipped, the best prepared, and the most
&gt; strongly motivated in the world.  We must implement the
&gt; recommendations through the Bottom-Up Review.  We must continue
&gt; to deal with the new threats of weapons proliferation and
&gt; terrorism.  We must continue our aggressive work at defense
&gt; conversion to save and create American jobs, and to maintain our
&gt; industrial base that is so critical for our national defense.
&gt; And we must reform the procurement process.
&gt; 
&gt;      Bill Perry comes extraordinarily well prepared to meet these
&gt; challenges.  I hope, and I trust that Congress will quickly
&gt; confirm him, and I look forward to working closely with him as an
&gt; integral part of the national security team.  I think he will do
&gt; a remarkable job.
&gt; 
&gt;      Dr. Perry?  (Applause)
&gt; 
&gt;      Dr. Perry:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, President
&gt; Clinton, for the confidence you've shown in me by this
&gt; nomination.  If I am confirmed, it will be a real privilege to
&gt; serve as your Secretary of Defense.
&gt; 
&gt;      I would like to take just a moment to introduce my family
&gt; that is here.  My wife Lee, my daughter Robin, and son David.
&gt; (Applause)  I have three other children not here today, and eight
&gt; grandchildren not here.  We have a large and happy family.
&gt; 
&gt;      Over the past year, I have welcomed the attention of
&gt; President Clinton to the challenge of reshaping our forces for
&gt; this new era.  We have worked to follow-up the vision that Les
&gt; Aspin had in establishing the Bottom-Up Review.  I appreciate,
&gt; also, Mr. President, your commitment to maintaining the readiness
&gt; and the morale of our fighting forces.
&gt; 
&gt;      I also look forward to serve because this is a time of great
&gt; change, great challenge, and great opportunity.  The national
&gt; security problems facing the United States today are complex and
&gt; difficult.  We are making a transition from the security posture
&gt; evolved to deal with the Cold War, to a very different security
&gt; posture.  I look forward to carrying out your commitment.  To
&gt; make those changes in a way that addresses the need of our
&gt; military and civilian personnel, our defense facilities, and the
&gt; communities that depend on them.
&gt; 
&gt;      This new security posture must deal both with the problems
&gt; in the post-Soviet world, while we simultaneously seize the
&gt; opportunities.  We read about the problems every day -- in
&gt; Mogadishu, Sarajevo, Pyongyang, but we must not lose sight of the
&gt; opportunities in this new post-Soviet world.
&gt; 
&gt;      For example, this year we have what I would call a window of
&gt; opportunity to make a major reform to the defense acquisition
&gt; system so that we combine modern equipment for our military
&gt; forces at affordable prices.  The President has already made a
&gt; commitment to readiness, but the acquisition and new equipment
&gt; deals with the forces five years hence, or ten years hence, so we
&gt; must look to that problem as well.
&gt; 
&gt;      I have the full commitment of the President to proceed on a
&gt; vigorous program of acquisition reform, and I believe that we can
&gt; work effectively with the Congress to establish real reform in
&gt; the system, and it's long overdue.
&gt; 
&gt;      Last week, Mr. President, at the NATO Summit meeting, we
&gt; provided leadership for the new Partnership for Peace in NATO.
&gt; This partnership opens the door to a security partnership with
&gt; our former enemies in the now extinct Warsaw Pact, but it does
&gt; not draw a line dividing Europe at the very time we are trying to
&gt; bring Europe together.
&gt; 
&gt;      We also provided the leadership for the historic agreement
&gt; on nuclear weapons reached at the Moscow Summit.  When fully
&gt; implemented, this agreement will see the country with the third
&gt; largest number of nuclear weapons in the world voluntarily become
&gt; a non-nuclear state with all of its nuclear weapons dismantled.
&gt; This summit agreement takes a major step back from the nuclear
&gt; abyss, and takes a major step forward for peace and stability in
&gt; the world.
&gt; 
&gt;      The British novelist Graham Greene once wrote, "There always
&gt; comes a moment in time when a door opens and lets the future in."
&gt; The ending of the Cold War opens such a door.  The summit
&gt; agreements will help us guide the future as it comes in.
&gt; 
&gt;      Mr. President, I have great respect for the way you have
&gt; been guiding our national security, and I am enthusiastic about
&gt; the opportunity to help you guide it.  I understand very well the
&gt; demands of this job and the strains that it puts on one's family.
&gt; My family and I have discussed this at considerable length this
&gt; weekend, and they fully support my decision.
&gt; 
&gt;      Mr. President, I am looking forward to working with you, the
&gt; Vice President, General Shalikashvili, Tony Lake, Warren
&gt; Christopher, and the rest of our national security team, and I
&gt; look forward to serving the American people.
&gt; 
&gt;      I thank you.
&gt; 
&gt;      (Applause)
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:   Did you have to be persuaded to take this job?  And
&gt; what do you think will be the toughest part of it?
&gt;      Dr. Perry:  No, I did not have to be persuaded to take the
&gt; job.  I met with the President to discuss this job Friday
&gt; morning, and I left that meeting fully prepared to take on the
&gt; job.  I had a meeting with my family that evening, because it's
&gt; not just me that's getting into this job.  I put them under
&gt; considerable strain when I do it, too.  We had a follow-up
&gt; meeting on Saturday morning with the White House where I told
&gt; them that if I had to accept the job at that time, my answer
&gt; would have to be no.  I met, then, with the Vice President, and
&gt; he told me I could take my time, take some time on the decision,
&gt; meet with my family further.  I took advantage of that.  On
&gt; Sunday afternoon I called the Vice President back and said if you
&gt; still want me for your Secretary of Defense, I'm eager to serve.
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:   Why did you have second thoughts?
&gt;      Q:   Why didn't you say yes immediately?  What did you have
&gt; to think about?
&gt;      Dr. Perry:  I tried to explain that.  It was because I did
&gt; not want to drive my family into a decision, into my decision
&gt; without their support, so I wanted to wait until I had their full
&gt; support for it.
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:   Mr. President, why was this job so hard to fill?
&gt;      President Clinton:  It wasn't easy to fill.  It wasn't hard
&gt; to fill, I mean.  We had an abundance of talented people to
&gt; consider, but I asked Secretary Perry and he said yes.  It wasn't
&gt; difficult at all.  I can't say any more than you already know
&gt; about what happened in the previous example, but we didn't go on
&gt; a big search here.  We had a very short list, and I quickly
&gt; narrowed it to one.  I had an interview with one person, I asked
&gt; him if he'd take the job, and he did.  I don't think that
&gt; qualifies it as difficult.
&gt; 
&gt;           Now I have had some difficult positions to fill.  This
&gt; one wasn't.
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:   What do you think he brings to the job that your
&gt; current Defense Secretary did not?
&gt;      President Clinton:  I don't think the two things are
&gt; related.  Secretary Aspin made his statement last month.  We had
&gt; our press conference on that.  We answered your questions.  It's
&gt; got nothing to do with what we've said here today.
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:   Are you going to go along with Secretary Aspin's views
&gt; on military women in planes and ships?
&gt;      Dr. Perry:  Yes.
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:  That's good.  (Laughter)
&gt;      Dr. Perry:  Secretary Aspin created many important legacies
&gt; this year.  I mentioned the Bottom-Up Review, his work on all of
&gt; the social aspects in the military.  In particular, his
&gt; advancement of women in combat is one which I enthusiastically
&gt; support.
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:   Is there anything at all in your background that's come
&gt; out over the past weekend that could conceivably cause you or the
&gt; Administration any problems during the Senate confirmation
&gt; process?  In that regard, I'm specifically also referring to the
&gt; so-called "nanny problem"?
&gt;      Dr. Perry:  Nothing has come out that I believe would cause
&gt; me any problems in the confirmation process.
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:   Dr. Perry, do you think that in terms of conservative
&gt; government in Moscow that there's a possibility there may be a
&gt; new Cold War starting?
&gt;      Dr. Perry:  I would observe that we cannot control the
&gt; events in other countries, including Russia.  But we can
&gt; influence them.  I believe the President has adopted a program to
&gt; assist, not just the Russians, but many of the former nations in
&gt; the former Soviet Union, to help stabilize their economy.  This
&gt; is the most constructive thing we can do to minimize the chance
&gt; of that unfortunate disaster occurring.
&gt; 
&gt;      Q:   Was your answer categorical about the nanny questions,
&gt; Dr. Perry?
&gt;      Q:   (inaudible)...the budgetary crisis that the Pentagon
&gt; faces and the possible difficulty you may have in actually
&gt; carrying out the blueprint the President has laid out?
&gt;      Dr. Perry:  In order to carry out the Bottom-Up Review with
&gt; the funds that are posed for it, we will have to manage the
&gt; Pentagon very well.  We will have to have real acquisition
&gt; reform.  We will have to have careful planning and management of
&gt; our programs.  We have to do all of this while we're maintaining
&gt; a very high level of readiness and a level of morale and cohesion
&gt; in the military forces.  It is a difficult management job.  I
&gt; believe it's doable, and that's what I'm undertaking to do.
&gt; 
&gt;      President Clinton:  Thank you very much.
&gt; 
&gt;                               (END)
