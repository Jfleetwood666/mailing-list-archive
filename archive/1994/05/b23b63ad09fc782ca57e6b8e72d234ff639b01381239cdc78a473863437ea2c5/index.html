nelson@sgi.com describes some of the precautions required to use DH
exchange safely:

** begin quoted text ***

The prime p wants to be chosen with a little care, 
and the "random" numbers a and b may want to be "selected" to 
eliminate certain undesirable values.  I'll explain below.

Within the field Z_p (the set of integers 0..p-1) where p is prime,
there are elements whose successive powers make up all the elements of
the field Z_p.  These numbers are called "primitive" elements or
"generators" of the field Z_p.  That is, if g is a generator of the field 
Z_p, then the successive powers g, g^2, g^3, ...  g^(p-2), g^(p-1) mod p 
include all the p-1 non-zero elements of Z_p.

The set of unique numbers produced by taking succesive powers mod p of an
element m of Z_p is a group, the "multiplicative span" of m, which is a 
subgroup of Z_p.  The number of elements in the group generated by m
is called the "order" of m.  Primitive elements of Z_p have order p-1.

Not all of the elements of Z_p are primitive.  

Some elements of Z_p have very small orders.  
At least one element will have order 2.

Given that p is prime, the orders of the elements of Z_p will all have
values that are products of some or all of the prime factors of p-1.
Since p is prime (and p=2 is not interesting ;-), p-1 will contain the
factor 2.

An small example may make this point clear.  Let p == 11.
The prime factors of p-1 are 2 and 5.  Hence we expect the orders of 
the elements of Z_11 to be 2, 5, or 10.  By enumerating the groups of 
the elements of Z_11 we see this is so (for Z_11).  E.g.

Element Ring                            Order
- ------  -----------------------------   -----
  1     1                                1
  2     2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9, 7, 3, 6, 1   10
  3     3, 9, 5, 4, 1                    5
  4     4, 5, 9, 3, 1                    5
  5     5, 3, 4, 9, 1                    5
  6     6, 3, 7, 9, 10, 5, 8, 4, 2, 1   10
  7     7, 5, 2, 3, 10, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1   10
  8     8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1   10
  9     9, 4, 3, 5, 1                    5
 10    10, 1                             2

There are 4 primitive elements in Z_11,  2, 6, 7, &amp; 8.
The orders of all the elements are as predicted by Euler.

Now, let us imagine that Alice and Bob have chosen 11 as their prime
and 7 as "g", their generator.

Following the steps outlined above:
&gt; Alice generates a random number a.  
	say 3
&gt; Bob generates a random number b.  
	say 5.
&gt; Bob tells alice g^b, Alice tells Bob g^a.
		  10                   2
&gt; Alice knows a and g^b, and thus generates g^(ab) trivially.  
					    10
&gt; Similarly, Bob knows g^a and b, and trivially generates g^(ab).  
							  also 10.
&gt; An interceptor only knows g^a and g^b, and because the discrete log
&gt; problem is hard cannot get a or b easily, and thus cannot generate g^(ab).

Except that the interceptor, evil Eve, took g^a and g^b and tested them
for short order, and found that one of them, g^b, had a very short order
indeed.  So, without knowing a or b, Eve knows that g^(ab) is one of a
very few numbers, the elements of the group of g^b.  She can now try the
elements of that group until, by exhaustion, she finds the value that
reveals the key g^(ab).

&gt; g^(ab) is now a shared secret of Alice and Bob.

And Eve, too.

Some primes produce lots and lots of elements with small orders.
For example, Z_37 has 12 primitives, 6 elements of order 18, and all
the rest have order 9 or less.

So, is DH all wet (insecure)?

No.  There are some simple steps to prevent this problem.  

First, pick p to minimize the number of elements with small order.
This means that we need to know the factorization of p-1.  Of course,
factoring large numbers is a hard problem, but there are several
ways to pick p with known factorization of p-1.

The simplest seems to be to pick p such that (p-1)/2 is prime; that is,
such that p-1 has two factors, 2 and (p-1)/2.  Now, all the elements of
Z_p will have orders of either 2, or (p-1)/2, or p-1.  There are other
methods, that permit other small orders, but we won't explore them here.

Second, after "randomly" choosing a, and computing g^a, Alice takes the
additional step of making sure that the order of g^a is not small (i.e.
is more than 2).  If g^a is of small order, she picks another random a,
and repeats the process.  This is trivial indeed.  Bob does likewise for
his numbers b and g^b.

Since Alice and Bob have eliminated the small groups, Eve will never
encounter a g^a or g^b number whose order is less than (p-1)/2, and
given that (p-1)/2 is a _very_ large prime number, Eve won't live long
enough to try all of the elements of groups of that order.

I haven't checked to see if the RSAREF code takes these precautions.

I wrote a Diffie-Hellman exchange program as an extension to PGP Tools.
It uses the PGP MPILIB and does up to 1024-bit key exchange, then MD5's
the shared secret to get an IDEA key. I took most of the precautions above. 
- From the DHEX10A manual (csn.org):

&gt;To use DH, we need a modulus n and a generator g. Unlike an RSA modulus,
&gt;which is a product of two primes, a DH modulus must be prime. (n-1)/2 must
&gt;also be prime. This makes the moduli slightly painful to find, but they can
&gt;be reused indefinitely. DHEX tests a modulus by first testing both n and
&gt;(n-1)/2 with fastsieve. Only if both pass is slowtest used. It still took
&gt;me a whole day to find the 1024-bit modulus in the demo. There is also a
&gt;512-bit modulus there.
&gt;
&gt;To find the generator, we need the factors of n-1. They are 2 and (n-1)/2.
&gt;For each factor f, we compute ((g^((n-1)/f)) mod n). If this is 1 for
&gt;either factor, the number is NOT a generator. Generators are easy to find,
&gt;usually in one to three tries.

The one precaution I did not take is: (from discussion above)

&gt;Second, after "randomly" choosing a, and computing g^a, Alice takes the
&gt;additional step of making sure that the order of g^a is not small (i.e.
&gt;is more than 2).  If g^a is of small order, she picks another random a,
&gt;and repeats the process.  This is trivial indeed.  Bob does likewise for
&gt;his numbers b and g^b.

Does the careful choosing of n and g eliminate this problem, or do I need
to modify my Diffie-Hellman code to check g^a for short order? How do you
check a number for short order?
