&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your interest in Digital Media.
&gt; 
&gt; EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING WATCHED? YOU WILL....
&gt; Postal Service and IRS mull national identity cards,
&gt; Clinton to sign orders
&gt; 
&gt; Digital Media has learned that the Clinton administration is debating
&gt; not if, but how, to create a card that every American will need in order
&gt; to interact with any federal government agency. Combined with two
&gt; potential executive orders and the Postal Service's designs on putting
&gt; its stamp on personal and business electronic transactions, the card
&gt; could open a window on every nuance of American personal and
&gt; business life.
&gt; 
&gt; The wrangling among the administration, the U.S. Postal Service, the
&gt; Internal Revenue Service and Department of Defense, emerged into the
&gt; public eye at this April's CardTech/SecureTech Conference. The
&gt; gathering of security experts was convened to discuss applications for
&gt; smart card and PCMCIA memory card technologies in business and
&gt; government. The Postal Service, at the conference presented a proposal
&gt; for a "general purpose U.S. services smartcard," which individuals and
&gt; companies would use to authenticate their identities when sending
&gt; and receiving electronic mail, transferring funds and interacting with
&gt; government agencies, such as the I.R.S., Veterans Administration and
&gt; the Department of Health and Human Services.
&gt; 
&gt; President Clinton is also considering signing two executive orders that
&gt; would greatly expand the government's access to personal records,
&gt; including an order that would allow the I.R.S. to monitor individual
&gt; bank accounts and automatically collect taxes based on the results,
&gt; said sources close to the White House. The collection service will be
&gt; presented as a convenient way to avoid filling out a tax return. The
&gt; White House did not respond to requests for comments about this
&gt; report.
&gt; 
&gt; The Post Office: We deliver for you. The Postal Service's U.S. Card
&gt; would be designed to use either smart cards (plastic cards with an
&gt; embedded microprocessor carrying a unique number that can be read
&gt; by a electromagnetic scanner and linked to computerized records
&gt; stored on a network) or PCMCIA cards, which can contain megabytes
&gt; of personal information. (You've probably seen this type card in
&gt; AT&amp;T's "You Will" ad campaign, which shows a doctor inserting a
&gt; woman's card in a reader in order to access a recording of a sonogram).
&gt; The Postal Service said it is considering AT&amp;T and other companies'
&gt; smart card technologies.
&gt; 
&gt; In a slide presentation at the conference, Postal representative Chuck
&gt; Chamberlain outlined how an individual's U.S. Card would be
&gt; automatically connected with the Department of Health and Human
&gt; Services, the U.S. Treasury, the I.R.S., the banking system, and a central
&gt; database of digital signatures for use in authenticating electronic mail
&gt; and transactions. The U.S. Card is only a proposal, Chamberlain
&gt; insists. Yet the Postal Service is prepared to put more than a hundred
&gt; million of the cards in citizens' pockets within months of
&gt; administration approval, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; "We've been trying to convince people [in the different agencies] to do
&gt; just one card, otherwise, we're going to end up with two or three
&gt; cards," said Chamberlain. He said in addition to the healthcare card
&gt; proposed by President Clinton last year, various government agencies
&gt; are forwarding plans for a personal records card and a transactions (or
&gt; "e-purse") card. Chamberlain said the I.R.S  in particular is pursuing
&gt; plans for an identity card for taxpayers.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't leave home without it. Though he did not name the U.S. Card at
&gt; the time, Postmaster General Marvin Runyon suggested that the Postal
&gt; Service offer electronic mail certification services during testimony
&gt; before the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee in March. The
&gt; proposal is clearly intended as a way to sustain the Postal Service's
&gt; national role in the information age, since it would give the agency a
&gt; role in virtually every legally-binding electronic transaction made by
&gt; U.S. citizens.  For instance:
&gt; 
&gt; * When sending or receiving electronic mail, U.S. Card users would be
&gt; able to check the authenticity of a digital signature to screen out
&gt; impostors.
&gt; * Banking transactions (notably credit card purchases) that depend on
&gt; authentication of the participants identities and an audit trail, would
&gt; be registered in Postal Service systems.
&gt; * Veterans, or for that matter college students and welfare recipients,
&gt; could check their federal benefits using the identification data on their
&gt; U.S. Cards.
&gt; * Visitors to an emergency room would have instant access to medical
&gt; records at other hospitals, as well as their health insurance
&gt; information.
&gt; 
&gt; These examples may seem benign separately, but collectively they
&gt; paint a picture of a citizen's or business's existence that could be
&gt; meddlesome at best and downright totalitarian at worst. Will buying a
&gt; book at a gay bookstore with a credit card that authenticates the
&gt; transaction through the Postal Service open a Naval officer up to court
&gt; marshal? If you have lunch with a business associate on a Saturday at a
&gt; family restaurant, will the IRS rule the expense non-deductible before
&gt; you can even claim it?
&gt; 
&gt; "There won't be anything you do in business that won't be collected
&gt; and analyzed by the government," said William Murray, an
&gt; information system security consultant to Deloitte and Touche who
&gt; saw Chamberlain's presentation. "This [National Information
&gt; Infrastructure] is a better surveillance mechanism than Orwell or the
&gt; government could have imagined. This goddamned thing is so
&gt; pervasive and the propensity to connect to it is so great that it's
&gt; unstoppable."
&gt; 
&gt; Deep Roots; Deep Pockets; Long History. Chamberlain said the Postal
&gt; Service has been working for "a couple years" on the information
&gt; system to back up the U.S. Card. He said the project was initiated by
&gt; the Department of Defense, which wanted a civilian agency to create a
&gt; national electronic communications certification authority that could
&gt; be connected to its Defense Messaging System. Chamberlain said the
&gt; Postal Service has also consulted with the National Security Agency,
&gt; proponents of the Clipper encryption chip which hides the contents of
&gt; messages from all but government agencies, like law enforcement. The
&gt; National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research
&gt; Laboratories in Mountain View, Calif. carried out the research and
&gt; development work for Clipper.
&gt; 
&gt; "We're designing a national framework for supporting business-quality
&gt; authentication," said John Yin, the engineer heading up the U.S. Card-
&gt; related research for NASA Ames' advanced networking applications
&gt; group. "This is not specifically with just the Postal Service. We'll be
&gt; offering services to other agencies and to third-party commercial
&gt; companies that want to build other services on the card." For example,
&gt; VISA or American Express could link their credit services to the U.S.
&gt; Card.
&gt; 
&gt; Yin, who works on Defense Messaging Systems applications, said his
&gt; group has collaborated with "elements of Department of Defense" for
&gt; the past year, but would not confirm the participation of the National
&gt; Security Agency, a Department of Defense agency. The NSA is
&gt; specifically prohibited from creating public encryption systems by the
&gt; Computer Security Act of 1987. Yin also would not comment on the
&gt; budget for the project, which other sources said was quite large and
&gt; has spanned more than two years.
&gt; 
&gt; A false sense of security? According to Yin, the cards would allow
&gt; individuals or businesses to choose any encryption technology. "It's not
&gt; our approach to say, 'Here's the standard, take it our leave it,'" he said.
&gt; "We're not trying to create a monopoly, rather it's an infrastructure for
&gt; interoperability on which a whole variety of services can be built." Yet,
&gt; NASA, which is a participant in the CommerceNet electric marketplace
&gt; consortium will "suggest" to its partners that they adopt the U.S. Card
&gt; certification infrastructure, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The reality is that government agencies' buying power usually drives
&gt; the market to adopt a particular technology Q not unlike the way the
&gt; Texas Board of Education, the largest single purchaser of textbooks in
&gt; the U.S., sets the standard for the content of American classroom
&gt; curricula. Since, the administration has already mandated use of
&gt; Clipper and its data-oriented sibling, the Tesserae chip, in federal
&gt; systems it's fairly certain that the law enforcement-endorsed chips will
&gt; find their way into most, if not all, U.S. Cards. Even in the unlikely
&gt; event that one government agency should weather the pressure and
&gt; pass on the Clipper chip, it's still possible to trace the source,
&gt; destination, duration and time of transactions conducted between
&gt; Clippered and non-Clippered devices.
&gt; 
&gt; "Most of this shift [in privacy policy] is apparently being done by
&gt; executive order at the initiative of bureaucracy, and without any
&gt; Congressional oversight or Congressional concurrence, " Murray said.
&gt; "They are not likely to fail. You know, Orwell said that bureaucrats,
&gt; simply doing what bureaucrats do, without motivation or intent, will
&gt; use technology to enslave the people."
&gt; 
&gt; EDITOR'S NOTE: Digital Media has filed a Freedom of Information
&gt; Act request for Clinton and Bush Administration, Postal Service, NSA,
&gt; Department of Defense, NASA, I.R.S. and other documents related to
&gt; the creation of the U.S. Card proposal.
