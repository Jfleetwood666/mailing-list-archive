&gt; Subj:	caller ID outrage from the FCC -- time to act
&gt; 
&gt; I've enclosed two messages from the Privacy digest about an outrageous 
&gt; FCC plan to undermine crucial privacy protections on caller-ID systems 
&gt; for telephones.  Caller-ID exists so that marketing companies can collect
&gt; information on unwitting consumers, and those same companies have lobbied
&gt; long and hard to eliminate simple, ordinary schemes to give people control
&gt; over whether this information is made available from their telephones.
&gt; Having lost this battle in many states, they have evidently moved to the
&gt; federal level.  But time remains for your comments to make a difference.
&gt; Please read the enclosed messages, judge for yourself, and act.

&gt; 
&gt; Private Unlisted Phone Numbers Banned Nationwide.
&gt; Law Enforcement Explicitly Compromised.
&gt; Women's Shelters Security Threatened.
&gt; Telephone Rules of 30 States Overturned.
&gt; Direct Marketing Association Anticipates Profit.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCC released its Report and Order And Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of
&gt; March 29th, 1994 (CC Docket No. 91-281)
&gt; 
&gt; With the arrogance that only federal bureaucrats can muster, the Federal
&gt; Communications Commission has turned the clock back on Calling Number ID
&gt; and privacy protection rules nationwide.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you ever had any trouble giving a direct marketer your phone number?
&gt; You won't any more.  Your Per Line Caller ID blocking will be banned,
&gt; thanks to the FCC Order which preempts the privacy protections provided by
&gt; 30 states.
&gt; 
&gt; The order carefully enumerates the concerns of law-enforcement agencies
&gt; which need per-line blocking to do their jobs.  It mentions the need
&gt; Women's shelters have for per-line blocking.  (A matter of life and death
&gt; on a day-to-day basis)  It mentions that the customers who attempt to keep
&gt; unlisted numbers confidential will be certainly be thwarted.  (Can one
&gt; train all kids and house-guests to dial *67 before every call?  Can you
&gt; remember to do it yourself?)
&gt; 
&gt; But the Order dismisses all of these problems, and determines that the
&gt; greatest good for the greater number will be accomplished if RBOC's can
&gt; profit a bit more by selling our numbers and if the direct marketers have
&gt; less trouble gathering them.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCC doesn't seem to trust consumers to be able to decide whether they
&gt; want per-line blocking.  It praises the $40 cost of an automatic *67 dialer
&gt; as an appropriate disincentive that will benefit the nation by discouraging
&gt; people's choice of per-line blocking.
&gt; 
&gt; There was one part of the order I was pretty happy about, until I read it.
&gt; The FCC has also banned the sale of numbers gathered by 800-900 number
&gt; subscribers using the ANI system, unless they obtain verbal consent.  (Note
&gt; that no rules prevent sale of numbers from the presumably blockable CNID
&gt; system.)  The problem is that the only enforcement of the rule seems to be
&gt; that the requirement must be included in the fine print of the ANI sale
&gt; contract between the common-carrier and the ANI subscriber.  So it seems to
&gt; be up to the common-carrier to enforce a rule which is contrary to their
&gt; financial interest.  How can a person who suffers from publication or sale
&gt; of their number recover compensation?
&gt; 
&gt; The FCC is soliciting comments, due May 18th
&gt; in their Further Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking on two issues:
&gt; 
&gt; o       Whether the Commission should prescribe more precise educational
&gt; 	requirements.
&gt; o	Whether and how the policies adopted on caller ID should be extended to
&gt; 	other identification services, such as caller party name or CPNI.
&gt; 
&gt; I can think of some suggestions...

&gt; Subject: FCC order on interstate Caller ID
&gt; 
&gt; 	[ From TELECOM Digest V14 #208 -- MODERATOR ]
&gt; 
&gt; I picked up a copy of the FCC's Caller ID order, which is available by
&gt; FTP as /pub/Orders/Common_Carrier/orcc4001.txt or orcc4001.wp.  (Kudos
&gt; to the FCC for making this info available so easily and quickly, by
&gt; the way.)
&gt; 
&gt; Much of the order is straightforward and not contentious, e.g.
&gt; delivering CNID between local and long distance carriers is so cheap
&gt; to implement that neither may charge the other for the data.  They
&gt; also note that per-call blocking is a good idea, and that *67 should
&gt; be the universal code to block CNID delivery.
&gt; 
&gt; But the arguments they list against per-line CNID seem, to me, to be
&gt; astonishingly specious.
&gt; 
&gt; There are three blocking options 1) per call for anyone, 2) per line
&gt; for anyone, and 3) per line for special groups.  The FCC thinks, not
&gt; unreasonably, that it's a mare's nest to ask the telco to implement 3,
&gt; since they have to determine who's in the special groups and who
&gt; isn't.  Then they say:
&gt; 
&gt; 	 43.  In the NPRM, we tentatively concluded that per line
&gt;     blocking unduly burdens calling party number based services
&gt;     overall by failing to limit its applicability to those calls for
&gt;     which  privacy is of concern to the caller.  The Commission noted
&gt;     that even in the case of law enforcement personnel, there may be
&gt;     a need to maintain calling number privacy on some calls, but that
&gt;     the same number may be used to telephone other law enforcement
&gt;     personnel, victims of crimes, cooperative witnesses, and family
&gt;     or friends.  The Commission asserted that in these types of
&gt;     calls, calling number privacy is not needed and calling number
&gt;     identification can actually be a valuable piece of information
&gt;     for both the caller and called parties.  The record reflects the
&gt;     useful nature of CPN based services, and the comments of
&gt;     Rochester illustrate that callers are likely to be interested in
&gt;     blocking only a small percentage of their calls.  The comments of
&gt;     USCG illustrate the usefulness of caller ID to emergency
&gt;     services.  In contrast, Missouri Counsel's analogy to unlisted
&gt;     numbers is inapposite because caller ID only permits parties
&gt;     called by the calling party to capture the calling party number,
&gt;     and then only if the calling party has not activated a per call
&gt;     blocking mechanism.  We find that the availability of per call
&gt;     unblocking does not cure the ill effects of per line blocking. 
&gt; 
&gt;     Moreover, in an emergency, a caller is not likely to remember to
&gt;     dial or even to know to dial an unblocking code.  For the
&gt;     foregoing reasons, we find that a federal per line blocking
&gt;     requirement for interstate CPN based services, including caller
&gt;     ID, is not the best policy choice of those available to recognize
&gt;     the privacy interests of callers.  Thus, carriers may not offer
&gt;     per line blocking as a privacy protection mechanism on interstate
&gt;     calls.  We agree that certain uses of captured calling numbers
&gt;     need to be controlled, and address that issue infra.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, per-line blocking is a bad idea because subscribers
&gt; are too dumb to unblock calls when they want to unblock them, although
&gt; they're not to dumb to block calls when they want to block them.
&gt; 
&gt; In paragraph 47 they note that where per-line blocking is offered,
&gt; telcos use *67 as a blocking toggle, so users can't really tell what
&gt; *67 does, but it doesn't seem to occur to them that the problem is
&gt; easily solved by requiring a different code for unblock than for
&gt; block.  In paragraph 48 they wave their hands and say that people who
&gt; care about privacy can just buy a box for "as little as $40.00 per
&gt; unit" that will stuff *67 in front of each call.  Thanks, guys.
