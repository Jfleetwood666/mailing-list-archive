THE CONFERENCE on LAW and INFORMATION POLICY for
SPATIAL DATABASES

October 28-29, 1994

Arizona State University
College of Law
Tempe, Arizona

SPONSORS

National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis
Center for the Study of Law, Science and Technology, Arizona
State University College of Law

CONFERENCE OVERVIEW

Geographic information systems (GIS) and their associated
databases are gaining widespread use throughout government and
the commercial sector in our communities, the nation, and the
world.  These automated mapping and analysis systems are
allowing the collection, integration and interrogation of vast
amounts of data.  The data and processing capabilities supplied by
the technology will constitute a significant component of the
emerging national information infrastructure.  This enabling
technology holds out the promise of increased efficiency in
commerce, improvements in the environment, health, and safety,
increased convenience for consumers, increases in participatory
government, and improved public and private decision-making
generally.  However, increased use of detailed databases and
processing capabilities also poses threats to the ideals of
democracies and rights of individuals - the ideals of freedom,
security, privacy, and open and free access to government.  As we
continue to move toward global economies and international
networked environments, the need to reconcile competing social,
economic, and political interests in digital geographic data will
greatly expand.

This conference brings together legal and information policy
experts with geographic information system specialists to explore
four interrelated aspects of information law critical to the handling
of geographic information: namely,
(1) intellectual property rights in spatial databases, with particular
emphasis on copyright;
(2) access rights of citizens to publicly held information, including
the policies of government agencies in charging for geographic
data;
(3) protecting personal privacy in using geographic information
systems; and
(4) liability in connection with the use, sharing, and distribution of
GIS data and analysis results.
