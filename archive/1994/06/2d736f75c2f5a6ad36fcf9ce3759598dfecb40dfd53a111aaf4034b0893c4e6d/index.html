Eli Brandt mentioned that the thread on timed-release crypto came up last
year. Here is a post I did on the subject.


&gt;Date: Wed, 10 Feb 93 11:55:45 -0800
&gt;To: cypherpunks@toad.com
&gt;From: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C. May)
&gt;Subject: Timed-Release Crypto
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cypherpunks,
&gt;
&gt;I want to share with you folks some preliminary ideas on "timed-release
&gt;cryptographic protocols," that is, methods for sending encrypted messages
&gt;into the future.
&gt;
&gt;These ideas need more work, but since I have recently mentioned them to Hal
&gt;Finney, Max More, Mark Miller, and perhaps others, I guess it's time to say
&gt;something here.
&gt;
&gt;Why would anyone want to send encrypted (sealed) messages into the future?
&gt;
&gt;1. Foremost, to send money into the future, while protecting it in the
&gt;meantime from seizure, taxation, etc. This might be of interest to cryonics
&gt;folks who want to arrange for their own revival/reanimation at some time in
&gt;the future. (Existing systems have relied on creating endowments, insurance
&gt;contracts, trust funds, and the like. The trust of the agent is the means
&gt;for sending funds into the future--clearly this agent could be compromised,
&gt;raided, taxed, put out of business, etc. Though I am personally not a
&gt;cryonics client, I began thinking about this problem in 1989 and talked it
&gt;over with Phil Salin, who, ironically, is now himself in cryonic
&gt;suspension.)
&gt;
&gt;2. To fulfill contracts with long payoff dates. One might wish to deliver
&gt;money at some future date, or to supply information at some future date.
&gt;
&gt;3. "In the event of my death"-type messages, with guaranteed delivery of
&gt;some message or text in the event that something happens (or, of course,
&gt;that the message is not "countermanded" by the sender).
&gt;
&gt;4. A software publisher might place source code in a timed-release escrow,
&gt;agreeing to release the code in 10 years, for whatever reason. (Of course,
&gt;he may lie, but that's another issue. Possibly the digital time-stamping
&gt;work of Haber and Stornetta can be used.)
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure you can think of other uses. I argue that this timed-release
&gt;message is a kind of cryptographic primitive...though it may be argued that
&gt;it's just a variant of an ordinary message transmission, albeit one through
&gt;time instead of through space.
&gt;
&gt;Diving right in, some approaches:
&gt;
&gt;A message is encrypted (standard public key means, though private key
&gt;methods work the same way) and "sent out." Perhaps into a network of
&gt;remailers or a Cuperman-style "pool" (BTW, my compliments to Miron C. for
&gt;deploying such a thing..the first of many, I suspect). The encrypted
&gt;message is just a "passive" item in this scheme...it stays encrypted, is
&gt;available to all, etc. (in other words, the security of the message being
&gt;time-released does not in any way depend on hiding the existence or
&gt;location of the encrypted message, though of course it is important that
&gt;the encrypted message be widely distributed and not explicitly advertised
&gt;or tagged as being a timed-release message.
&gt;
&gt;(Detail note: Why not? Because some governments may see timed-release
&gt;messages as automatically being tax-avoiding, cryonics-supporting,
&gt;seditious, etc., messages and may attempt to hunt down and erase any such
&gt;messages...perhaps via "hunter-killer crypto viruses" or somesuch.)
&gt;
&gt;Let us suppose the encrypted message is to be unlocked in 30 years. (It
&gt;could also be when some recognized event occurs, such as a Mars landing or
&gt;the death of the sender, or whatever...you'll see how this works). How can
&gt;the decryption key be prevented from being used in the meantime?
&gt;
&gt;(To make this clear: both the encryted message _and_ the decryption key are
&gt;"in circulation" during all of those 30 years. Any scheme that relies on
&gt;the sender himself keeping the decryption key "secret" for those 30 years
&gt;is of course no fun at all...it's just what we have today and involved no
&gt;new cryptographic primitives, just ordinary human-mediated secrecy.)
&gt;
&gt;But if the encrypted message and the decryption key are both in circulation
&gt;for all of those 30 years, what's to keep someone from decrypting the
&gt;message in _one_ year, for example?
&gt;
&gt;The answer: independent escrow agents who handle large volumes of messages
&gt;and agree to hold them for various amounts of time. Because they have no
&gt;idea of what's insided the encrypted messages they hold--and some may be
&gt;"test" messages deposited deliberately by reputation-rating or
&gt;credentialling agencies, such as "Consumers Crypto Guide"--and because
&gt;their business is holding things in escrow, they will not generally open
&gt;messages before the time specified.
&gt;
&gt;"Aha!," I hear you exclaim, "Tim's scheme depends solely on the trust of
&gt;these escrow agents, and that's no different from depositing a sealed
&gt;envelope with your friendly lawyer and asking him to promise not to peek."
&gt;
&gt;Here's how crypto and reputation-based sytems make my scenario different
&gt;(and stronger, I am arguing):
&gt;
&gt;- an ecology of many escrow services, many pools, many encrypted-message
&gt;senders makes for a more robust system against subversion of any single
&gt;agent.
&gt;
&gt;- no escrow agent knows what is contained in a sealed message, hence the
&gt;tempation to peek is reduced. (A wrinkle: escrow agents, like remailers,
&gt;will probably go to automatic hardware that is tamper-resistant (cf.
&gt;discussion of tamper-resistant or tamper-responding, modules in the Crypto
&gt;Glossary distributed at the first physical Cypherpunks meeting and
&gt;available in the archives). Thus, the hardware will automatically execute
&gt;certain protocols and make peeking a pain.)
&gt;
&gt;- the best escrow agents (someday) may in turn increase security and their
&gt;own reputations by in turn using secondary contracts, i.e., by contracting
&gt;with _other_ escrow agents to seal parts or all of their messages.
&gt;
&gt;- what results is that the original message is scattered around in various
&gt;publicly available locations (perhaps paid-for by dribbles of cryto-money
&gt;from crypto escrow agents, but this is a detail easily worked out in
&gt;various ways). The decryption key to the original message is itself broken
&gt;up into several or many pieces and scattered to a network of
&gt;"remailer"-like agents (they are essentially "remailers into the future,"
&gt;by agreeing as part of their protocol to hold messages for some amount of
&gt;time). As time passes, these various messages (pieces, remember) are
&gt;retrieved, forwarded, and generally bounced around the network.
&gt;
&gt;- some escrow agents may be just "fixed delay" nodes. For example, "Alice's
&gt;Rest Stop" remailer node widely advertises that it will take in messages
&gt;and simply delay them for some fixed time, e.g., for a year. For some fee
&gt;based on message size. (Clearly the fixed time delay is a crufty approach,
&gt;much less flexible than variable delays negotiated by the messages
&gt;themselves, but it makes the idea clearer in some ways: a network of many
&gt;such one-year delays could thus "send" a message into the future in
&gt;one-year jumps.)
&gt;
&gt;(It is important to remember that these messages are "first-class objects,"
&gt;to borrow a phrase, and that all messages essentially look the same and
&gt;have the same "rights" (Dean Tribble is probably barfing at my
&gt;appropriation of object-oriented lingo, but it seems appropriate). That is,
&gt;inspection of the bytes will not reveal to someone whether the message is a
&gt;$2 message, a simple love letter, a business contract, a remailed item, a
&gt;$100K cryonics payment, etc. Thus, the "authorities" cannot simply target
&gt;some class of messages and ban them or launch "hunter-killer crypto
&gt;viruses" against them, at least not without shutting down the whole
&gt;system!)
&gt;
&gt;- the individual pieces may have instructions attached, such as "You will
&gt;be paid 10 crypto credits if you hold me for one year and then decrypt me."
&gt;(Not to belabor the point, but the means by which this "contract" can be
&gt;enforced are that the escrow agents never know when they're being tested,
&gt;when they're being monitored by rating services. This kind of "trust" is
&gt;what allows ordinary deposit banks to work...their business is talking
&gt;deposits and lending money, not repudiating the honest claims of
&gt;customers.)
&gt;
&gt;- thus, I envision a swarm of messages being stored-and-forwarded in space
&gt;and time, with an observor seeing only  bits flowing around. Nobody except
&gt;the original "launcher" (who needs to be fairly careful about the path he
&gt;selects, about robustness against some fraction of the escrow/remailer
&gt;agents going out of business, etc.) knows what's going on.
&gt;
&gt;- and as the end of the 30 years period approaches, to continue with the
&gt;example I started with, the decryption key gets "reconstituted" in various
&gt;ways (depends on what is desired, and how protocols evolve...I don't claim
&gt;to have the details already worked out). For example, after 30 years the
&gt;various messages stored in escrow accounts are forwarded separately to "The
&gt;Immortalist Foundation," which may in fact be a digital pseudonym (as we
&gt;have discussed so many times here). This entity puts the pieces together,
&gt;sort of like combining the missing pieces of a text and reconstituting a
&gt;genie or demon, and finds it can now unlock the original encrypted message.
&gt;It finds, say, a million crypto credits, or the location of some physical
&gt;treasure, or whatever.
&gt;
&gt;(Needless to say, there are some obvious questions about what long-term
&gt;money will be stable, what banks will still exist after 30 years, and so
&gt;on. I expect new forms of time deposits to evolve. Can the original sender
&gt;be expected to know what will evolve before he seals his original message?
&gt;Some obvious issues to work on--I never claimed it would be trivial, or
&gt;static. One approach is to allow some human intervention, where an
&gt;"investment agent" opens a digital money message, redeems it, and reinvests
&gt;it in some new instrument. As usual, he would not know who the original
&gt;investor was and would be "tested" by reputation-rating agencies. It _does_
&gt;get complicated, I know.)
&gt;
&gt;The Key Point: Messages sent into this network of remailers, escrow
&gt;accounts, pools, and investment agents are untraceable to the sender and
&gt;are generally unidentifiable. To break a single message involves breaking
&gt;the entire system (or colluding with enough remailer nodes, as in any
&gt;DC-Net sort of system). As with remailer networks, the expectation is that
&gt;they will become sufficiently pervasive and trans-nationalized that
&gt;breaking the entire system is just too painful and difficult (much the way
&gt;the Net is already too pervasive to easily shut down, even if some uses of
&gt;it are undesirable to various national authorities).
&gt;
&gt;Timed-release messages are objects that can be transmitted, encrypted, and
&gt;can carry further instructions on where to mail them next, on how much
&gt;digital money to pay to this next link, and various other instructions or
&gt;protocols.
&gt;
&gt;(In other words, they are "agents" that can negotiate various contracts,
&gt;for remailing , for storage, etc. Since they are "powerless" in a human
&gt;sense, their security is provided by double-checks--perhaps by other agents
&gt;who are watching and waiting--and by the general "shell-game" system of
&gt;reputations, credentialling, and so on.)
&gt;
&gt;To make this scheme clearer in a simple way, I could publicly post an
&gt;encrypted message to this list, or in one of the "pools," and then scatter
&gt;the decryption key in several pieces with several members of this list,
&gt;paying them $1 each to "hold" their piece for, say, a month. At the end of
&gt;the month, they would fulfill their end of the bargain by forwarding the
&gt;piece they hold to some public place or pool and the decryption key would
&gt;be reconstituted (don't press me for exact details....PGP doesn't support
&gt;this directly, but could). For robustness against loss of some of the
&gt;messages, an n-out-of-m voting scheme could be used (e.g., any 5 of 8
&gt;pieces are sufficient to reconstruct the decryption key).
&gt;
&gt;The result is a message from the past, a timed-release message.
&gt;
&gt;I'm anxious to hear your comments. I think such a cryptographic primitive
&gt;could be useful for a lot of purposes.
