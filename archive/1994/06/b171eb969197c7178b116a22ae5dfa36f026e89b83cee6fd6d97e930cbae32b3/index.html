ONE DAY DEADLINE!  The House Intelligence Committee will probably make their
decision on this vital issue tomorrow afternoon, Wed. June 15, 1994.  If
you've not had your say on whether the State Dept. &amp; NSA will be allowed to 
continue to restrict the flow of public cryptographic products, write, call
and fax *today*.  Updated fax information for the entire Intelligence Cmte.
is below.  

The Committee seems receptive to hearing alternatives to the extreme position
held by the National Security Agency - what you have to say does matter!


From: gnu@eff.org (John Gilmore)
Subject:  URGENT:  Please Tell Congress to Allow Encryption Export
Reply-To: ask@eff.org (rather than send us email please fax +1 202 225 1991)

        House Intelligence Committee holds key to Crypto Export
         ask@eff.org     June 14, 1994      *DISTRIBUTE WIDELY*

Today, the U.S. State Department controls the export of most
encryption, working closely with the National Security Agency (NSA) to
limit products that provide real privacy, from cell-phones to PC
software.  A bill introduced by Rep. Maria Cantwell would instead give
authority over non-military crypto exports to the Commerce Department.
Commerce has much more reasonable regulations, with "First
Amendment"-style unlimited publishing of publicly available software,
including PGP, Kerberos, RIPEM, RSAREF, and mass-market commercial
software.  The bill also prevents the Commerce Dept. from tightening
the regulations even if NSA somehow gets its tentacles into Commerce.

A few months ago, you-all sent over 5600 messages to Rep. Cantwell in
support of her bill, H.R. 3627.  As a result, on May 18, the bill
passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee by being incorporated into
the Export Administration Act of 1994, H.R. 3937.

Now the battle has become more intense.  This portion of H.R. 3937 has
been referred to the House Intelligence Committee with the intent to
kill or severely maim it.  We need your help again, to urge the
Intelligence Committee to keep crypto export liberalization intact.

The House and Senate Intelligence Committees, the only watchdogs for
the NSA, tend to follow the agency's wishes when they wave the magic
"national security" wand.  They need plenty of input from the public
that tells them that the nation will be *more* secure with good
encryption, even though the NSA will be less happy.

Not just computer users, but all users of telephones, cable TV, health
care, and credit information systems would benefit from this change.
The security of these applications is built on the foundation laid by
the operating systems and network protocols on which they run.  If
this bill is passed, you will see high quality encryption built into
Microsoft Windows, into the MacOS, into major Unix workstations, into
the Internet, into cellular phones, into interactive television.  The
software already exists for confidentiality, privacy, and security of
local and networked information, but it's not built-in to these
systems because of the export ban.  Today, each company could build
two operating systems, one gutted for international use, but this
would be costly and confusing for them and their customers, and would
not allow international networks such as the Internet or telephones to
be made secure and private.  With this bill, these limits disappear.

Furthermore, the Clinton Administration plans to permit high volume
exports of Clipper products, while continuing to require tedious
paperwork for truly secure encryption products.  The bill would give
Clipper and other crypto software more even-handed treatment.

The bill also eliminates a senseless situation on the Internet.
Today, crypto software can only be freely distributed from non-U.S.
archive sites.  It would eliminate that problem as well as the threat
of prosecution against U.S. freeware authors of crypto software.

This is the dream we've all been working toward.  Here's how you can
help to make this dream a reality.  The Intelligence Committee must
make its decision on the bill before June 17, so time is critical:

1) Fax a short letter TODAY to the chair of the Intelligence
Committee, Representative Dan Glickman (D-KS).  Ask him in your own
words to leave the encryption provisions of H.R. 3937 intact.  Use a
positive tone ("Please support...") rather than a flame or a rant.
One paragraph is fine.  State your title and organization if you will
look more important or better informed than the average citizen.  Rep.
Glickman's committee fax number is +1 202 225 1991.  This is the best
option, since individual letters are given the most weight by members
of Congress, particularly when sent on letterhead paper.

2) If you are unable to fax a letter, send an e-mail message to Rep.
Glickman at glickman@eff.org.  Software or staff at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation will either fax it in, or print it out and
hand-deliver it for you.

3) Send a copy of this message to everyone you know in Kansas, and
personally urge them to write to Rep. Glickman today.  Letters from
constituents get a lot more weight, since they are from people who
could actually vote for or against him in the next election.

4) If your own Representative is on the Intelligence Committee, send
him or her a copy of what you sent Rep. Glickman.  There's a list of all
such Reps. below.  Even if we lose this battle, you will have started
educating your own Rep. about crypto policy.

5) Become a member of EFF.  Our strength comes from our members' strength.
Send a note to membership@eff.org asking how to join.

Thanks again for your help!  You can check at any time on the current
status of the campaign at the location below.  Send any comments on
this campaign to campaign@eff.org.
