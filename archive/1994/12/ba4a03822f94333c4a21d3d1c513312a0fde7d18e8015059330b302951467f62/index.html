The remailers need a one-time reply mechanism.

This would enable many other things, including "persistent" anonymous
entities, without using broadcast techniques. The current remailers
encourage hit-and-run anonymity, like the recent burst of anonymous
nastiness, and discourage conversational anonymity and persistent
anonymous entities. Sending a one-way message is easy and fairly secure.

Creating a reply ticket is not very secure. The ticket can be replayed
through the net to trace the path taken, and since the text following
the ticket it sent in clear, it is easy to trace. The ticket can also
be decrypted by coercion or hacking of the remailer machines. In general,
there is enough persistent information available to trace any reply ticket.
This is a bad thing.

A one-shot reply ticket would be designed so that, after the ticket was used
or a set time had passed, the ticket was no longer valid and the information
needed to trace the path, partially stored in the remailers, was gone.

One way to do this: each remailer has a list of secret (symmetric) keys.
Each secret may have an expiration date. By some method (problem discussed
later) the user and the remailer establish a shared secret, adding it to the
list, while the remailer does not find out who the user is. The reply ticket
contains a series of nested hops, each encrypted with that remailer's secret
plus all the others after it.

When the ticket is used, the remailer decrypts one layer of the ticket to
obtain the next hop. It then encrypts the message with that secret key. Now
it forgets the secret key (poof!) and passes the message and remainder of
the ticket on to the next remailer.

The ticket is getting decrypted at each hop, and the message is getting
encrypted. Thus there is nothing recognizable between hops, and the trail is
burning up as the message propagates. At the terminal end, the recipient
applies all of the secret keys in the proper order to decrypt the message.
Of course, an additional end-to-end public-key encryption is also an option.

The catch: how do we establish a shared secret with the remailer, without
identifying ourselves to it? If the first remailer (the one the replyer
sends the ticket to) is corrupt, and it knows who established the secret
contained in the ticket, it knows the end-to-end path of the message.

Solution 1: each remailer has a public key. To establish shared secrets with
a series of remailers, you send a normally-chained and nested message, using
each remailer's public key. Each remailer decrypts a layer, stores the
secret contained for it, and passes the message on. The first few remailers
may not get secrets; they are just there to anonymize the message.

  Problem: secret-establishing message is replayed, setting trail back up,
  then reply ticket is replayed. Solution: when a secret is used, it is
  one-way hashed, the hash stored, the secret forgotten. Secrets which have
  already been used will not be accepted the second time. When the used
  secrets list gets full, a new public/secret pair is generated and the old
  one is forgotten, preventing any more replays. 

    Problem: remailers are coerced or hacked to decrypt a captured secret-
    establishing message, before the secret key is expired. Trail of a reply
    ticket can then be followed. Solution: no good one that I can think of.

Solution 2: establish a shared secret by a simple, direct Diffie-Hellman
exchange with the remailer. You send a public-piece in a message, remailer
sends you a public-piece, both sides compute the secret. If the remailer is
corrupt, it now knows who you are. This is a level-1 secret.

Use the level-1 secret as a reply ticket to establish a secret with another
remailer. Message goes through a remailer, to the target you want to
establish a secret with. Target replies using the level-1 secret. This is a
level-2 secret; two remailers have to be corrupt to trace this secret to
you. If you want, use the level-2 secret for another exchange to create a
level-3 secret, and so on until your comfort zone is reached. An automatic
program sits around stockpiling secrets for you. Problem: high bandwidth.

Does anyone know of a better way to establish a shared secret in an
untraceable way? Both of these methods have their problems.

Given a secure two-way messaging mechanism, persistent anonymous identities
are established using a "pigeonhole service". This is a service, with a
publicized address, that will accept public-key encrypted mail and store it
in a "pigeonhole". The owner of the pigeonhole anonymously sends a request
(with authentication) and a reply ticket. The pigeonhole service sends the
owner his mail using the ticket.

Anonymous users would need a client that could set up trails, create
tickets, request mail from the pigeonhole, etc. One nice feature of the
system is that non-anonymous users could talk to anonymous users without
having a client. The anonymous message would be of the form:

--- BEGIN REPLY TICKET (LEAVE AT HEAD OF REPLY) ---
(Reply ticket ciphertext)
--- END REPLY TICKET ---
Message text

The non-anonymous user could reply with any mail reader, send the message
back to the remailer that sent it to him, and the message would be
transported securely back to the anonymous user that sent it.

For something complex like this, we need a language with a little more
leverage than C provides. For this and other complex protocols, I've ported
RSAREF 2.0 to Perl. The interface does not require you to recompile Perl.
It uses a C daemon and pipes. It provides symmetric encryption, public-key
encryption, digital signatures, hashing, DH exchange, and ASCII armor.
The algorithms used are MD5, MD2, DES, DESX, triple-DES, RSA, and DH.
It has a good (eval/die) exception handling mechanism, and a very thorough
regression testing script.

For reliability in a large remailer network, end-to-end reliability is
better than point-to-point reliability. Messages should be m-of-n secret
shared before transmission, and reassembled at the terminal end. For
clientless reception, the terminal node remailer could do the reassembly
and splitting of replies.

Code for secret sharing is available, but most secret-sharing algorithms
create shadows each the size of the message. This can be avoided: use an
error correcting code to add enough information to the original so the
message can be recreated with any m of n pieces. Break into pieces, encrypt
each piece, and secret-share the key. Where can I get an error correction
algorithm that can do this? You should be able to increase a file's size by
50% and then have any two of three pieces recreate it, for example.

I want to add other algorithms to the Perl encryption package. The secret
sharing, for one. A one-function call to gzip for compression. A blind
signature if I could get patent permission (not from Chaum; how's Brands?)
or perhaps just do it with a "research purposes only" disclaimer. Someone
with Visual Basic experience could do a DOS/Windows VBX module to enable
easy writing of PC clients for neat net-based servers written with the Perl
encryption package.

As Tim, Eric and others have pointed out, the problem of widespread, usable
crypto is essentially the whole problem of interoperability across a
network. Covering Unix for servers and Windows for clients would be a
large step in the right direction.
