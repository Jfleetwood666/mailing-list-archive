Sincere apologies if someone's sent this to the list before....

Forwarded message:
&gt; This comes to you courtesy of Del's friend Joe Levy:
&gt; 
&gt; Would you all mind distributing this as much as possible?  I, and every
&gt; net-surfer who is concerned about her/his rights, are trying to stop Big
&gt; Brother from taking over, and need all the help we can get.  There may be more
&gt; serious letters later on.  For now, just enjoy a slightly ridiculous one.  All
&gt; the best, and don't get struck by flying pygmies, as always.
&gt;                                                          Forever,
&gt;                                                                Joe
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;                      The Emperor's New Brain
&gt;                       by Blimix (Joe Levy)
&gt; 
&gt;           (With apologies to Hans Christian Anderson.)
&gt; 
&gt;      Once upon a time, there was an Emperor.  He had been voted
&gt; into office fairly easily, because he had managed to impress people
&gt; with his brain.  But once he realized that the job demanded more,
&gt; he said, "My brain is too small!"  So he had posters hung on every
&gt; blank wall in the kingdom, proclaiming the need for skilled neural
&gt; surgeons/tailors to weave him a new, better, bigger brain.  "Soon,"
&gt; he thought, "I will have a good brain and will be able to govern my
&gt; empire properly, and all the people will love me, and I'll be so
&gt; cool that there'll be chicks hanging around me all the time...
&gt; Maybe I'll even get a car, or put up the bestest BBS in the
&gt; world..." and so on.  What he didn't know what that he was saying
&gt; all of this out loud, and that a small band of rogues had been
&gt; shadowing him for the duration of his monologue.  When the Emperor
&gt; had left to pursue other activities, due to the rather self-
&gt; exciting nature of his mostly derailed train of thought, the rogues
&gt; spoke amongst themselves.
&gt;      "Will you listen to that, mate?" commented NSA.  "The poor
&gt; chap really hasn't got a clue!"
&gt;      "Yeah, let's put him out of our misery," remarked FBI.
&gt;      "Be quiet, will you?" said CIA.  "You dolt, don't you see the
&gt; prospects here?  We can rule this place.  NSA and NIST have the
&gt; plan.  Where is NIST, anyway?"
&gt;      "He'll be along, shortly.  He had some business with that
&gt; hotshot DES.  Chopped half of DES's - thing - off, he did.  Ugly
&gt; business," replied NSA.
&gt; 
&gt;                              *  *  *
&gt; 
&gt;      "Sire, there are some important-looking men to see you," said
&gt; the page.
&gt;      The Emperor jumped.  "What?!?  Oh!  Okay, I'll be down
&gt; shortly.  Um, you didn't... see anything... did you?"
&gt;      "No, Sire," the page replied immediately.
&gt;     The Emperor left to wash his hand.
&gt; 
&gt;                              *  *  *
&gt; 
&gt;      "You mean you can weave a tremendous brain for me if I just
&gt; bring you all the doors, window blinds and roofs in the kingdom,
&gt; using your Clippers?"
&gt;      "Yeah, but there's also the matter of payment," said CIA.
&gt;      NSA spoke.  "We understand that you have, in the castle
&gt; vaults, a supply of magical potions of growth.  Those will do
&gt; nicely."
&gt;      "But those are the only ones in the kingdom!  We have saved
&gt; them since the days of my great-great-great-great-grandmother,
&gt; what's-her-name!"
&gt;      FBI stood to his full, rather impressive height, and looked
&gt; down at the suddenly small-feeling Emperor.  "This is what's best
&gt; for the kingdom, isn't it?  You need a brain, and we need the
&gt; potions.  Do you really want to argue?"
&gt;      "Uh... of course not." was the meek response.
&gt;      "Good.  Now that that's settled-" began NSA.
&gt;      "But what if the peasants want to keep their roofs and doors
&gt; and blinds?" interrupted the Emperor.
&gt;      NSA confidently replied, "They won't.  We'll make sure that
&gt; they know it's all for the common good.  Besides, those things are
&gt; only needed to conceal things.  People who have nothing to hide
&gt; have no cause to resent this, do they?  Besides, if against all
&gt; likelihood, our idea is rejected by the public, we can simply put
&gt; everything that we took away back again.  And don't think for a
&gt; moment that we would be looking into the houses of innocents.  No,
&gt; we can help you take care of your subjects.  They will look up to
&gt; us as kindly Big Brothers."
&gt;      "I'm quite capable of taking care of the kingdom myself,"
&gt; asserted the Emperor.
&gt;      "Nonsense," CIA remarked.  "We're the ones building you this
&gt; brain, right?"
&gt;      "Right," the Emperor acquiesced, though he wasn't quite sure
&gt; that the conclusion followed logically from this.  He felt there
&gt; was something slightly wrong, but since he could not tell what, he
&gt; decided not to risk making a fool of himself.
&gt;      "Then we can begin!" roared FBI.
&gt; 
&gt;                              *  *  *
&gt; 
&gt;      At the scoundrels' insistence, the Emperor ordered every
&gt; construction worker in the kingdom to work on the dismantling of
&gt; the houses, using their new Clippers.  Thus did the infrastructure
&gt; suffer, as roads crumbled, and prices rose, while the economy began
&gt; a slow but accelerating collapse.  Just inside the castle, a ragged
&gt; collection of peasants met with the Emperor.
&gt;      "Why are your goons doing this to us?" cried one woman.  "I
&gt; can't get to work anymore!"
&gt;     And old man spoke up.  "Without a roof, we can't keep the
&gt; rains off of us!  My whole family has pneumonia!"  Several others
&gt; shouted their agreement.
&gt;      "I was willing to sacrifice for the kingdom," lamented a
&gt; former merchant.  "I willingly gave them all of my wood, and put up
&gt; paper instead.  They ripped it down!  And they didn't even use it!
&gt; They just said I couldn't have anything covering me."
&gt;      "I'm sure there are perfectly reasonable explanations for all
&gt; of this."
&gt;      Suddenly four towering figures entered, and herded the
&gt; peasants outside.  "There's no such thing as rain!  Stop
&gt; complaining!"  A few families were trampled during the confusion,
&gt; but no one noticed.
&gt; 
&gt;                              *  *  *
&gt; 
&gt;      It was only a week later that the smoke was first seen.
&gt; Behind the castle, the tremendous stockpiles of collected wood were
&gt; being burned.
&gt;      "My kingdom is collapsing!" cried the Emperor.
&gt;      "And we know why!" exclaimed FBI.  "There are secret societies
&gt; of witches that oppose us.  But our spies, KGB and Mccarthy, have
&gt; been rooting them out.  That is what the fires are for."
&gt;      "But you're burning the wood that you said you would save!"
&gt;      "SO WHAT?!?!?!?"
&gt;      "Okay, as long as you put it that way.  What about my brain?"
&gt;      This caught FBI by surprise, for he had completely forgotten
&gt; about the deal.  Luckily, CIA happened to be in the room, and
&gt; glibly replied, "The chemical reactions going on right now are the
&gt; final processes in the construction of the brain."
&gt;      "Oh, goody."  The prospect of the new brain cheered up the
&gt; Emperor, and he forgot about his dying kingdom.
&gt; 
&gt;                              *  *  *
&gt; 
&gt;      Witch-burnings were becoming common.  The rogues, now grown to
&gt; immense size, regularly reached into houses, plucking out the
&gt; occupants, and placed them on the huge bonfires.  The first ones
&gt; taken, of course, were the poor peasants who had originally spoken
&gt; up.  Then, anyone who had a brain was considered a potential
&gt; threat, and made into a scapegoat.
&gt;      "What did this woman do that makes you believe she's a witch?"
&gt; the Emperor asked.
&gt;      FBI replied, "She turned me into a n-"
&gt;      "Shut up," said NSA.  "We discovered a rumor about strange
&gt; activities going on in her house.  We checked it out, and surely
&gt; enough, we found this."  He triumphantly held up a rather well-
&gt; executed painting of a swan launching itself into flight from an
&gt; alpine lake.
&gt;      "What is its relevance to witchcraft?"
&gt;      NSA began, "First, the canvas can be used to shield her from
&gt; sight, so she obviously has something to hide.  Also, the drawing
&gt; itself is obviously a dangerous example of freedom propaganda.  As
&gt; we all know, freedom cannot be tolerated.  We also intercepted this
&gt; letter from her to her band.  It proves that she and the twenty
&gt; other people named here are witches."
&gt;      Working her mouth free of the gag, the woman cried, "I didn't
&gt; write that!  It's not even in my hand-"  FBI cut off her protest by
&gt; flinging her into the blazing conflagration.
&gt; 
&gt;                              *  *  *
&gt; 
&gt;      NSA congratulated his friends.  "Well, lads, we've made a
&gt; killing.  Besides having the power to do whatever we want to
&gt; whomever we want, our Clippers are selling like wildfire, since
&gt; they're the only product that anyone is allowed to buy now.  Can
&gt; you believe we actually managed to convince people that those
&gt; things are useful?"  They all laughed heartily at this.  "It's
&gt; probably time to invite the Emperor back into the castle."
&gt;      At their call, his Excellency dutifully entered.  "We finished
&gt; your brain last night, and implanted it while you were sleeping in
&gt; the stables," claimed CIA.  "It is indeed huge, and, being made
&gt; from pure energy (released by the burning wood), weighs virtually
&gt; nothing.  We fashioned it in such a way that only a person without
&gt; personal problems can see it, so that you may judge this
&gt; characteristic in people with ease."
&gt;      FBI held up a mirror to facilitate the Emperor's viewing of
&gt; his new brain.  "How do you like it?"
&gt;      Though he saw nothing but his own reflection, he said, "It is
&gt; a good brain.  I like the laurels particularly.  Let's hold a
&gt; parade, so that all may see The Emperor's New Brain!"
&gt; 
&gt;                              *  *  *
&gt; 
&gt;      And so it was.  The day came, and the broken people trudged
&gt; through the pitted streets to finally view the great result of
&gt; their even greater sacrifice.  As they waited expectantly for the
&gt; parade train, they wondered, "Was the loss of our privacy and
&gt; freedom of thought worth a slightly more effective government?"
&gt; But they could do nothing more than wonder, for to speak thusly
&gt; would mean certain death.  So, they mutely held their only
&gt; possessions, the Clippers, which had been the instruments of their
&gt; downfall.
&gt;      A wave of excitement swept through the crowd, as the arrival
&gt; of the parade was heralded.  All knew of the wondrous properties
&gt; that the Brain possessed, and were eager to see it for themselves.
&gt; As the crowd held its breath, the Emperor came into view.  And no
&gt; one was surprised that they could not see the brain, because they
&gt; knew perfectly well that they had problems.  But this could not be
&gt; admitted.  Words of praise floated through the air.  "How regal it
&gt; is!"  "That brain is huge!"  "I like the color scheme."  "Now he'll
&gt; be able to solve all of our problems."
&gt;      "That brain doesn't exist," said a junior programmer.
&gt;      "Well, neither do we," said a philosopher.
&gt;      "No, I mean it!  There's no brain there!" the programmer
&gt; insisted.  And gradually, the crowd became aware of the truth of
&gt; his words.
&gt;      "The Emperor doesn't have a brain!" they all shouted.  They
&gt; picked up fragments of concrete that had once been a sidewalk, and
&gt; started throwing them.  Luckily for the Emperor, this behavior was
&gt; quelled when FBI stepped on the offending parties.
&gt;      The survivors were too weak, due to lack of protection from
&gt; the elements, to fight back.  And while the all-powerful villains
&gt; lived comfortably for the rest of their lives, a nation died.
&gt;

&gt;      Don't let Clipper be YOUR downfall.  Learn as much as you can,
&gt; than do whatever you can to educate others, and let your
&gt; representatives and senators know how you feel.  Wired is a good
&gt; source of information.  Read the April issue.  Or gopher to
&gt; wired.com to see their database.  Lazarus Long and I will be
&gt; putting up Clipper-dedicated databases of our own.  (More
&gt; information to follow.)
