&gt;
&gt;I noticed that the discussion is currently about the e-cash system of
&gt;DigiCash. Some good issues have been raised in the discussion, and I
&gt;would like to comment in detail about my own opinion in these matters.
&gt;As it so happens, I recently wrote an article that addresses in detail
&gt;each of the raised concerns, and for this reason it seemed easiest to
&gt;simply make this article available by ftp. So I did. The paper is
&gt;entitled "Electronic Cash on the Internet," and will appear in the
&gt;Proceedings of the Internet Society 1995 Symposium on Network and
&gt;Distributed System Security, San Diego, California, Februari 16-17,
&gt;1995. To retrieve it: log in anonymously at ftp.cwi.nl, and go to the
&gt;directory pub/brands.  There you will find the paper, in both dvi and
&gt;PostScript format (and Unix-compressed formats). The paper contains
&gt;several drawings; if you want to have the complete paper, including
&gt;the pictures, then you *must* retrieve the PostScript version. I made
&gt;a particular effort to explain the concepts behind the system (many of
&gt;which are due to Chaum); see Section 3, it is about five pages with no
&gt;math.
&gt;
&gt;  Short abstract of the paper: It is generally realized that the Internet
&gt;  will not be able to offer full-fledged electronic marketplace
&gt;  capabilities without a suitable electronic mechanism for processing
&gt;  payments. The electronic payment mechanism that is presented offers a
&gt;  variety of features that are believed to be particularly appealing in
&gt;  this respect.
&gt;
&gt;  To participate, an Internet user must interface to his computer a
&gt;  tamper-resistant device with an ordinary 8-bit microprocessor,
&gt;  typically a PCMCIA card, and install some software. Internet service
&gt;  providers do not need special hardware. Payments can be made
&gt;  completely *off-line*, and are untraceable and unlinkable.
&gt;  Multi-party security is guaranteed without parties having to trust
&gt;  other parties.  Transaction processing speeds are such that even
&gt;  modestly equipped computers will be able to meet the performance
&gt;  levels required by demanding Internet payment applications.  One
&gt;  particularly interesting such application is click-and-pay ability
&gt;  when travelling World-Wide-Web links.
&gt;
&gt;The presented approach may seem to be less attractive than many other
&gt;proposals, because it requires tamper-resistant hardware for the
&gt;users. In the longer run, though, when the use of e.g. smart cards for
&gt;electronic payments has become commonplace, the advantages in my
&gt;opinion will significantly outweigh this objection. What will remain
&gt;are the advantages: click-and-pay ability to make instantaneous
&gt;off-line payments, the ability to cost-effectively serve tens of
&gt;millions of participants, the ability to guarantee one's own privacy,
&gt;multi-party security, support for different currencies, and
&gt;portability of tamper-resistant devices to other payment platforms.

&gt;Some brief comments on the current discussion:

&gt;   &gt;I've been looking at the Ecash payment system and was wondering about
&gt;   &gt;the problem of scalability if it were to become popular.
&gt;   &gt;(For anyone who doesn't already know, Ecash is an electronic cash
&gt;   &gt;solution, details of which can be found at http://www.digicash.com )
&gt;   &gt;It seems to me that, while their bank (bank.digicash.com) will be able
&gt;   &gt;to handle the 10,000 odd users in the trial, how would it cope with the
&gt;   &gt;possibly thousands of transactions that might take place all over the
&gt;   &gt;Internet, every minute, if the system were to become popular?
&gt;   &gt;Every transaction requires that the merchant shop, connect to the bank
&gt;   &gt;to validate the customers coins, right?
&gt;   &gt;With a popular Ecash system, the bank would be swamped, or what if even
&gt;   &gt;the link to the bank went down for a few days?

&gt;   &gt;There has to be a single common database which all the banks share in
&gt;   &gt;order to detect double spending. Otherwise I could spend the same coin
&gt;   &gt;multiple times, going to a different bank each time. Granted, shared
&gt;   &gt;databases can work, but if a machine which holds part of the database goes
&gt;   &gt;down it will take special engineering to keep things consistent and
&gt;   &gt;available.
&gt;   &gt;There are two different senses in which we can speak of multiple banks.
&gt;   &gt;One is a setup where all the banks share the same type of cash, where
&gt;   &gt;they are logically a single bank but distributed to try to get increases
&gt;   &gt;in reliability. This has the database consistency and access problems I
&gt;   &gt;described above, which modern-day bank systems don't have to the same
&gt;   &gt;extent.
&gt;
&gt;   I fully agree with these comments. Btw, it is correct that the e-cash
&gt;   system of DigiCash is an *on-line* *coin* system. It is interesting to
&gt;   take a look at their faq, at
&gt;    http://www.digicash.com/ecashinfo/ecash-faq.html, item
&gt;   "Does ecash really have to be online?". There is sais: "Actually, no. [...]
&gt;   We'll add some more functionality in that area as soon as the on-line
&gt;   system is completely operational." Furthermore, in item "If I copy my
&gt;   money, can I spend it twice," it sais: "In an off-line
&gt;   situation (future) ..." From these comments of DigiCash, it seems that
&gt;   they very well realize the problems associated with on-line verification
&gt;   when the system is used on a large scale, and that they hope to implement
&gt;   an off-line system in the future. However, a problem with this might be
&gt;   the following, as noted by Jim McCoy (mccoy@io.com):
&gt;   &gt;[first part]
&gt;   &gt;A digital money system can do that, but the current version of Chaum's
&gt;   &gt;system does not.  The disadvantage of a system that does this
&gt;   &gt;self-identification of double-spenders is that it front-loads the cost of
&gt;   &gt;the identification protocol into everyone's withdrawls and purchases; they
&gt;   &gt;must use a cut-and-choose system during withdrawl to make sure that the
&gt;   &gt;coins presented for blinding are in the proper format and must perform an
&gt;   &gt;additional protocol negotiation during purchases.
&gt;   &gt;[...] The overhead involved in the necessary machinations to make sure
&gt;   &gt;that a malicious cheater did not send in bogus coins that mis-identified
&gt;   &gt;him increases the transaction cost of such a system significantly.  It also
&gt;   &gt;increases the transaction cost of purchases by requiring the merchant and
&gt;   &gt;purchaser to perform an additional transaction to reveal halves of the
&gt;   &gt;identity bits after each purchase.
&gt;   &gt;[second part]
&gt;   &gt;It is an interesting version of the
&gt;   &gt;digital coin protocols, but one that is unlikely to be used in the
&gt;   &gt;immediate future due to the increased costs it places upon the system.  It
&gt;   &gt;is likely that such a system will first appear in smartcard digital cash
&gt;   &gt;systems where dedicated hardware can cut down on the increased costs.
&gt;
&gt;   The first part is correct, the overhead caused by the cut-and-choose
&gt;   withdrawal protocols seems unacceptable. Another problem, which
&gt;   certainly should not be forgotten, is that is can hardly be said to be
&gt;   sufficient if only traceability of double-spenders after the fact is
&gt;   offered. It is clearly desirable that there is prior restraint of
&gt;   double-spending, and ideally the traceability ater the fact should still
&gt;   be present (as a second line of defense). Now, doing off-line cash with
&gt;   prior restraint of double-spending, *and* privacy of payments, seems to
&gt;   result in extremely inefficient systems when one uses the cut-and-choose
&gt;   technique of Chaum/Fiat/Naor (just try it, and you'll see what I mean...).
&gt;   Probably these are the main reasons why DigiCash has not implemented an
&gt;   off-line system. (Yet a third problem is that it is really cumbersome
&gt;   to use a coin system if each coin is several kilo-bytes...)
&gt;
&gt;   This is not to say that efficient privacy-protecting off-line cash systems
&gt;   with prior restraint of double-spending do not exist. The system that I
&gt;   present in my paper mentioned above meets all these criteria. The
&gt;   reason for this is that I do *not* use a cut-and-choose withdrawal protocol.
&gt;   As those of you who have tried to design off-line systems will
&gt;   know, the design in fact consists of two protocols, one for paying and one
&gt;   for withdrawal; designing the withdrawal protocol is by far the
&gt;   hardest task (which is still an understatement...). The
&gt;   technique that I use for my withdrawal protocols is a new one, called
&gt;   restrictive blinding, and the only one known thus far that can provide
&gt;   efficient withdrawal protocols. Curiously enough, most of the withdrawal
&gt;   protocols that result from this technique are *not* ordinary blind
&gt;   signature protocols as defined in
&gt;   literature (because only the signature is blinded---the message is not!).
&gt;   The withdrawal protocol in my Internet paper is a blind signature protocol,
&gt;   but for instance the withdrawal protocol that I used in my technical
&gt;   report (reference 5 in the paper) is not.

&gt;   &gt;I wish I could. I have applied several times for the beta test at
&gt;   &gt;digicash, starting almost three months ago. Finally I got a reply at the
&gt;   &gt;beginning of November saying that I would be hearing from them in a few
&gt;   &gt;days. Since then, nothing. I wonder if people are actually being
&gt;   &gt;allowed to join the beta trial as are implied by all of these web pages?
&gt;   &gt;I would like to see a more honest explanation of the chances of being
&gt;   &gt;able to experience ecash than the simple "click here to try it out" you see
&gt;   &gt;everywhere.
&gt;
&gt;   I had exactly the same experience; I sent in the registration several
&gt;   months ago. I'm still waiting for my account, which was announced to me at
&gt;   the beginning of this month.
