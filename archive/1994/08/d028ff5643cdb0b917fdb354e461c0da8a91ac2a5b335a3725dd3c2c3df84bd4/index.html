-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

There has been much Meta Discussion of late.

There has also been much but not too much trivial and meta-meta stuff,
of which I gues I would have to categorize _this_ posting. I don't
suppose anyone is interested in metabolizing this any further...

All I have to do is take a break for a few days and I have 
these 457 New Messages to catch up on. You all know what I 
am talking about, I presume. Now that I have lost my job,
and am more or less finished with soaking the hapless taxpayers,
I can finally get around to doing those things I have previously
referred to as homework, and turn them around into revenue 
generating memes. I am going to unsub for a week or so, and 
::exclude all for a while, and unsub permanently from anything
else except moribund IMP - I'll wait to see if anything happens
in that arena - cypherpunks have assumed control over IMP memes
anyway...so that when I get back, there will only be regular
personal mail from net.friends and darters (my secret passion -
a wonderful type A behaviour pattern) mail. I may have only
five weeks of net.access at this address, anyway, but my seniority
and status as alumnus and donor and decus membership entitle me to 
to historical use of my bill@kean.ucs.mun.ca True Name address. I can,
I expect, get a forwarding privilege as part of my severance package,
although I _will_ be going to a commercial internet service as
soon as I get a round tuit. There are other possibilities, which
I wont bore you with right now.

So I'm off to write some code, do some homework, and take some
annual r &amp; r. Before I go, I thought I'd send this rant to the
list, just one message or so before I send the appended .sig in
to the Idea Factory for maintenance.

We have discussed this before, so maybe after my Annual General
Meeting coming up this Perseids, deep in the woods, I'll come up
with an idea of how to make this come about - how to, say, 
achieve the goal - meanwhile I am just going to rant.

I want Extropian mailing list software equivalent for Cypherpunks!

Others want it. It has been mentioned as a possibility. I understand
there are some intellectual property rights involved, but jesus
h christ as my old man used to say, what can we say about the
intellectual property rights of prz that we now take for granted?

 [Did anyone notice the AP article about prz the other day that
  was okay as a news bite but they spelled his name incorrectly!]

  [[Someone with a much-too-long-but-only-occassionally-used .sig
   also spells his name wrong...homework for another cypherpunk...]]

I understand there are machine property rights involved, too.
Perhaps these can be hashed out at TAZONO. I'll be there in spirit,
if not in the flesh nor by upload...

I know there are other problems, too, but hey, this code has already
been written.

Let's get it done. I haven't yet used the ::exclude features of
Extropian list software for Extropian mail, but I could _sure_
use it for cypherpunk mail.

Meanwhile I am about to unsub cypherpunks for a week, and ::exclude
all for a while, and I'll be back RSN with some non-meta harangues.
Opps, redundancy noted.

Some notes for the future :
	1. HEx will reanimate itself as a reputation market.
	   I have to read some Chaum, first.
	2. INFO_Banque will spontaneously order itself into
	   existence. I have to read some Chaum, first, and
	   tend to some other stuff.
	3. Watch for the INFO_Banque_Protocols and the 
	   INFO_Banque_PPL. I claim copyright to these
	   words...I guess I am going to have to sign this rant.
	4. Perhaps I should sign all my future postings as a
	   matter of personal discipline and policy, as I
	   embark upon some personal self-transformation.
	5. Perhaps I should invent another pseudonym for
	   myself. It is known publically, although not widely,
	   that I sometimes write things for an alter ego
	   personality I have named Wendell Noseworthy. The
	   new nym will have to be a credentialled entity...
	   But I have to read some Chaum first, and I _still_
	   can't find a copy of Schnier in our library and
	   now that I need all my paper cash to feed my
	   replicant units, well, there may be some delays 
	   involved...

Meanwhile, I will be interested in receiving encrypted mail from
cypherpunks and Extropians, just for practice, of course. Very
soon now I hope to get my PGP key signed by somebody, but I
have been waiting a decision on moving to 2.6ui or 2.7...or 3.

Use this public key for now, and we can verify it later in life.
You can check the signature if you wish and let me know if I
have made any blunders.

So, as I said, I'm off for some R&amp;R to write some meta-code. I'll
retire this .sig below now, [perhaps another message or two will
sneak through to other channels...] Copyright 1994, right now, me. 
Please do not distribute this rant.
