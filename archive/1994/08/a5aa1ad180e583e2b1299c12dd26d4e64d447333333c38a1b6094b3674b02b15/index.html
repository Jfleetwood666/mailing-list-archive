I have one small addition to the analysis I did yesterday of remailer
chaining effects.  Previously I was assuming that there was a uniform
distribution of messages across remailers, so that all saw the same
number of packets.  How does this change if some remailers are used
more than others?

Again I will sneak up on the problem by taking a concrete example.
Suppose there are two remailers and that we are using two-remailer
chains which include the possibility of using the same remailer twice.

Suppose one of the remailers is used much more than the other.  Take
an extreme case, where remailer 1 is used 90% of the time and remailer
2 is used 10% of the time.  If we suppose that these probabilities
affect both the choice of the first and second remailer in the chain,
then the four possible chains have the following frequencies of use:

1,1   81%
1,2    9%
2,1    9%
2,2    1%

Notice that this also implies that 90% of the messages enter the net
at remailer 1 and 10% at 2, and also that 90% leave via 1 and 10%
leave via 2.

Now, ignoring for a moment the fact that there may be some reason
people are shunning 2 (they suspect it is compromised, or it is
unreliable, or something - but maybe it's just new and a lot of people
haven't heard about it yet), what is the safest way to use this
network?

The key, I believe, is to imitate the observed statistics in your own
choice of a chain, at least for the 2nd hop.  90% of the messages
coming out of the first stage of either remailer will go to remailer
1.  If you want your message to be lost most effectively among the
others, you should choose remailer 1 as your own 2nd hop 90% of the
time.  This way your message will be 9 times more likely to go to 1
than 2, but since there is 9 times the traffic going to 1 than to 2 it
will be perfectly masked.

The result will be that your message is equally likely to be any of
the N messages coming out of the remailer.  Your statistics will match
all of the others.  Therefore, you get a full factor of N mixing with
such an unbalanced network, just as much as you get with a perfectly
symmetrical network - as long as you imitate the network statistics.

The choice of the first remailer in your chain does not appear to be
critical.  We assume the opponent can see which remailer you have
chosen (by tracking your message from your site to the remailer) so
there is no advantage to choosing 1 over 2 as far as secrecy.  You
will get full N-fold mixing in either case.  This is a bit
counter-intuitive; it might seem that choosing 1 is superior to
choosing 2 in terms of mixing.  But look at a specific example:

Suppose 100 messages enter the network, 90 at 1 and 10 at 2.  After
the first step, 9 messages go from 1 to 2 (10% of the 90) and 9
messages go from 2 to 1 (90% of the 10).  Then 90 messages are sent
from 1 and 10 from 2.  Now, if your message entered at 2, but had a
90% probability of going to 1 at the second hop, then there is a 90%
chance that it ended up as one of the 90 messages leaving 1, and a 10%
chance that it ended up as one of the 10 messages leaving 2.  This
tells observers exactly nothing about where your message is.  So
choosing 2 as the first hop is just as good as choosing 1.

Although I have not yet extended these results to longer hops and
larger numbers of remailers, my guess is that the same general rule
will apply there as well.  This suggests that it will be useful and
important to have accurate information about the usage levels of the
various remailers so that you can accurately mimic those
probabilities.

How bad is it if you don't have accurate usage information?  According
to my calculations, in the case of two remailers, if the actual
probabilities of the two remailers being used are p and 1-p, and the
probabilities you use are q and 1-q, the mixing level you get
decreases from N to N * (p/q)^q * ((1-p)/(1-q))^(1-q).  If q=p and you
have accurate information there is no reduction.  In the example
above, with p=.9, if you didn't know this and used q=.5, your mixing
level reduces to N*.6.  This is not a huge reduction even for this
rather extreme case, but I can't guess how this will extend to larger
networks and chains.

Assuming these results do hold true, though, it suggests some
interesting "market" dynamics.  Patterns of usage of the remailers may
tend to be stable since anyone who departs from the current usage
pattern will stand out and hence lose security.  It may be difficult
for new remailers to become established since their initial usage
level will be low, making it risky to use them to any significant
degree.  These considerations are somewhat similar to situations where
there are competing but incompatible standards (e.g. Beta vs VHS
VCR's) in terms of the barriers to entry.

There may also be considerable misinformation about usage levels.  It
will be to the advantage of a site to exaggerate the number of
messages they are handling.  Especially if noise messages are used (a
strategy I haven't tried to analyze yet) it would be easy to generate
bogus statistics.  Maybe some organization could collect statistics by
polling remailer users about their practices rather than believing the
operators, and make that information available.

Another point is that, assuming that remailer operation is actually
going to be profitable some day, there will be advantages to being one
of the first to market.  Getting your remailer widely known and used
in the early days could establish market leadership which will have
considerable staying power just from the inherent properties of how
these networks work.  Heavily-used remailers could charge premium
prices while the "little guys" have to be cut rate in order to grow,
compensating users for the loss of security they will experience.

Maybe this will encourage people to make the investment to become what
Tim May has called "Mom and Pop" remailers.  This might be the golden
opportunity to get in on the ground floor.  For more information, send
