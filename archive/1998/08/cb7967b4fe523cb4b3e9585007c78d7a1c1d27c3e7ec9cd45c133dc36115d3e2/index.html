Dear Friend:

If you have already responded to the following announcement a few
days ago, that means your package is already on its way and it
should be arriving soon! If you have not responded to this before,
please pay attention to it now. This is very important!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
IMPORTANT ACCOUNCEMENT
 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Your future May Depend on it !
 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Before you know about this 'Important Announcement', you must
first read the following 'Editorial Excerpts' from some important
publications in the United States:

NBC NIGHTLY NEWS: "Members of 'World Currency Cartel', who 
always keep a low profile, are considered to be some of the most
wealthiest people in North America".

 "In concluding our review of Financial organizations to effect 
change in the 90's, special attention should be called to a California based 
organization, 'WORLD CURRENCY CARTEL'. Members of this 
organization are amassing hundred of millions of dollars in the currency 
market using a very LEGAL method which has NEVER been divulged to 
the general public.  While their purpose is not yet known, their presence 
has most certainly been felt".
 

More excerpts later, but first let us give you this very
'IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT":
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

We are glad to announce that for the first time and for a very
short period of time, WORLD CURRENCY CARTEL will instruct a
LIMITED number of people worldwide on 'HOW TO CONVERT $25 INTO ONE
HUNDRED OF LEGAL CURRENCY'. We will transact the first conversion
for you, after that you can easily and quickly do this on your own
hundreds or even thousands of times every month.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS "SECRET FLAW" !
******************************************************************
******************************************************************

 
It is even more explosive than we have yet disclosed. While
currency does fluctuate daily, we can show you 'HOW TO CONVERT $99
INTO $588 AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT'. That means, you will be able
to EXCHANGE $99, AMERICAN LEGAL CURRENCY DOLLARS, FOR $580 OF THE
SAME. You can do this as many times as you wish, every day, every
week, every month. All very LEGAL and effortlessly!
 
It takes only 5 to 10 minutes each time you do this. You can do
this from home, office or even while traveling. All you need is
an access to a phone line and an address. Best of all, you can do
this from ANY CITY ON THIS EARTH!!!
 
Again, we must reiterate, anyone can do this and the source is
NEVER-ENDING. For as long as the global financial community
continues to use different currencies with varying exchange rates,
the "SECRET FLAW" will exist.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
As we said earlier , we will do the first transaction for you and
will show you exactly how to do this on your own, over and over
again!
 
The amount of exchange you would do each time is entirely up to
you. Working just 2 to 10 hours a week, you can soon join the list
of Millionaires who do this on a daily basis many times a day. The
transaction is so simple that even a high school kid can do it!
 
We at the World Currency Cartel would like to see a uniform global
currency backed by Gold. But, until then, we will allow a LIMITED
number of individuals worldwide to share in the UNLIMITED PROFITS
provided for by the world currency differentials.
 
We will espouse no more political views nor will we ask you to do
so. We can say however, that our parent organization, NDML,
benefits greatly by the knowledge being shared, as we
ourselves, along with YOU, benefit likewise. Your main concern
surely will be, how you will benefit.

As soon as you become a member, you will make transactions from
your home, office, by telephone or through the mail. You can
conduct these transactions even while traveling.

Don't believe us? Experience it for yourself!
  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Unlike anyone else, we will assure you great financial freedom and
you will add to our quickly growing base of supporters and join
the list of MILLIONAIRES being created using this very "SECRET
FLAW" in the world currency market.

WALL STREET: "A discreet group of Americans, operating under the
guise of World Currency Cartel have recently begun making rumbles in
world finance market. While at this time, their game is not completely
known, they certainly will be watched by those making major moves in the
currency contracts".

FINANCIAL WEEK: "Watch them, monitor them, extract their knowledge
and try to become one of them. That is the soundest financial
advice we could give to anyone".

NATIONAL BUSINESS WEEKLY: "While this reporter has been left in
the cold as to its method of operation, we have been able to
confirm that 'World Currency Cartel' and its members are literally
amassing great fortunes overnight".
