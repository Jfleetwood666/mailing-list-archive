&gt;Big Brother Banks? FDIC has snooping plans
&gt;By David M. Bresnahan
&gt;Copyright 1998 WorldNetDaily.com
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Are you a potential criminal? Are you a threat to banks, airlines, a
&gt;potential spy, or perhaps an IRS tax protester? The government
&gt;would like to know and they are about to force banks to be their
&gt;detectives.
&gt;
&gt;The federal government wants banks to investigate you. Soon your
&gt;banker will know more about you than anyone else in town. Banks
&gt;must not only determine your correct identity, they must also know
&gt;how you make your money, and how you spend it. Once you
&gt;establish a pattern of deposits and withdrawals, banks must inform
&gt;federal agencies when you deviate.
&gt;
&gt;Bank customers may soon find themselves explaining to the FBI,
&gt;Internal Revenue Service, and the Drug Enforcement Agency why
&gt;they made a $15,000 deposit to their bank account. According to
&gt;current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation plans, banks will
&gt;soon establish "profiles" of their customers and report deviations
&gt;from those profiles.
&gt;
&gt;If you sell a car, for example, and place the proceeds in your
&gt;account while you shop for a new one, a red flag may go off in the&gt;bank
&gt; computer. Such a situation puts law abiding citizens in a
&gt;situation where they must prove they are innocent, says Scott
&gt;McDonald of the watchdog group Fight the Fingerprint.
&gt;
&gt;An uproar from grass roots Americans is the only thing that will
&gt;stop the current plans for the FDIC "Know Your Customer"
&gt;program, according to McDonald. His organization has led the
&gt;charge against the national ID, medical ID, and computerized
&gt;information about private aspects of people's lives.
&gt;
&gt;A recent announcement by the FDIC provides for citizen comment
&gt;prior to implementation of their new banking regulations. The
&gt;deadline for comments is Dec. 27, 1998.
&gt;
&gt;"The FDIC is proposing to issue a regulation requiring insured
&gt;nonmember banks to develop and maintain 'Know Your Customer'
&gt;programs," according to a recent FDIC information package sent
&gt;to Congress to provide notice of proposed rulemaking, and to
&gt;banks for comment.
&gt;
&gt;"As proposed," the 29-page FDIC document begins, "the
&gt;regulation would require each nonmember bank to develop a
&gt;program designed to determine the identity of its customers;
&gt;determine its customers' source of funds; determine the normal
&gt;and expected transactions of its customers; monitor account
&gt;activity for transactions that are inconsistent with those normal and
&gt;expected transactions; and report anytransactions of its customers
&gt;that are determined to be suspicious, in accordance with the
&gt;FDIC's existing suspicious activity reporting regulation. By
&gt;requiring insured nonmember banks to determine the identity of
&gt;their customers, as well as to obtain knowledge regarding the
&gt;legitimate activities of their customers, the proposed regulation will
&gt;reduce the likelihood that insured nonmember banks will become
&gt;unwitting participants in illicit activities conducted or attempted by
&gt;their customers. It will also level the playing field between
&gt;institutions that already have adopted formal 'Know Your
&gt;Customer' programs and those that have not."
&gt;
&gt;Many banks across the country have already begun to implement
&gt;such programs, according to the FDIC. A quick search of the
&gt;Internet found many stories in press accounts of problems reported
&gt;at such banks. There have been a number of stories dealing with
&gt;banks requiring fingerprints to open accounts and to cash checks.
&gt;There are several lawsuits presently underway testing the right of
&gt;banks to make that requirement.
&gt;
&gt;McDonald has been fighting that issue, along with fingerprints on
&gt;driver's licenses for some time. He pointed out the many errors
&gt;found on credit reports and suggested that banks will soon make
&gt;similar errors when they begin creating profiles of their customers.
&gt;
&gt;The FDIC is selling the planned regulations by pointing out the
&gt;need for prevention of financial and other crime.
&gt;
&gt;"By identifying and, when appropriate, reporting such transactions
&gt;in accordance with existing suspicious activity reporting
&gt;requirements, financial institutions are protecting their integrity and
&gt;are assisting the efforts of the financial institution regulatory
&gt;agencies and law enforcement authorities to combat illicit activities
&gt;at such institutions," says the FDIC.
&gt;
&gt;The proposed regulation is, according to FDIC spokesperson Carol
&gt;A. Mesheske, authorized by current law. It comes from the
&gt;statutory authority granted the FDIC under section 8(s)(1) of the
&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 18189s)(1), as amended
&gt;by section 259(a)(2) of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L.
&gt;101-647).
&gt;
&gt;The FDIC claims that the law requires them to develop regulations
&gt;to require banks to "establish and maintain internal procedures
&gt;reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the
&gt;Bank Secrecy Act. Effective 'Know Your Customer' programs
&gt;serve to facilitate compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act."
&gt;
&gt;The proposed regulations will mandate that all banks insured by
&gt;the FDIC must maintain an intelligence gathering department that
&gt;screens out customers and keeps an eye on existing customers.
&gt;Before you decide to move your money to a credit union, you
&gt;should know that the FDIC is not the only federal organization
&gt;making such plans.
&gt;
&gt;"Each of the other Federal bank supervisory agencies is proposing
&gt;to adopt substantially identical regulations covering state member
&gt;and national banks, federally-chartered branches and agencies of
&gt;foreign banks, savings associations, and credit unions. There also
&gt;have been discussions with the Federal regulators of non-bank
&gt;financial institutions, such as broker-dealers, concerning the need
&gt;to propose similar rules governing the activities of these non-bank
&gt;institutions," reports FDIC attorney Karn L. Main in the proposal.
&gt;
&gt;The purposes for the regulation are to protect the reputation of the
&gt;banks, to facilitate compliance with the law, to improve safe and
&gt;sound banking practices, and to protect banks from being used by
&gt;criminals as a vehicle for illegal activities.
&gt;
&gt;Current customers will be subjected to the new regulation in the
&gt;same way new customers will be scrutinized. The FDIC does not
&gt;wish to permit any loop hole which would leave any bank
&gt;customer unidentified or unsupervised.
&gt;
&gt;Each bank will create profiles. The first profile will determine the
&gt;amount of risk a potential customer might present by opening an
&gt;account. The system of profiling potential customers will be
&gt;different from one bank to the next, since the FDIC does not
&gt;provide a uniform program. The purpose of the profile is to
&gt;identify potential customers who might use a bank account for
&gt;funds obtained through criminal activity.
&gt;
&gt;The next profile will be one that is used by automated computers
&gt;to determine when suspicious activity is taking place in an account.
&gt;When activity in the account does not fit the profile, banks will
&gt;notify federal authorities so they can investigate.
&gt;
&gt;Banks are expected to identify their customers, determine normal
&gt;and expected transactions, monitor account transactions, and
&gt;determine if a particular transaction should be reported.
&gt;
&gt;The FDIC has sent copies of the proposal to all banks and is
&gt;asking for input. The questions asked by the FDIC in the proposal
&gt;do not ask whether the regulations should be put into place, only
&gt;how to implement them in the best way. None of the questions in
&gt;the proposal are directed to bank customers.
&gt;
&gt;The FDIC reassures banks that because the requirements will be
&gt;universally applied to all banks it will not hurt their business and
&gt;drive away customers. The proposal does not mention penalties for
&gt;non-compliance, nor is there any mention of regulations to provide
&gt;access to bank records by customers so errors can be found and
&gt;corrections made.
&gt;
&gt;"If 'Know Your Customer' programs are required, insured
&gt;nonmember banks can more easily collect the necessary
&gt;information because customers cannot turn readily to another
&gt;financial institution free of such requirements," stated the proposal.
