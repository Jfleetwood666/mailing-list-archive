It is said, "dead men tell no tales."  If that were true, then
America would have never known of the real story behind the
Clinton administration.  Two dead men are calling from their
graves for the last few years of their lives to be told.  The
ghosts of Vince Foster and Ron Brown hover over Bill Clinton.

Vince Foster and Ron Brown were both involved in the Clinton -
China encryption scandal.  One known event took place in May
1993 when Vince Foster, Webster Hubbell and Bernard Nussbaum
paid the National Security Administration (NSA) a visit.  These
three fine gentlemen, with close connections to Hillary Clinton
and the Arkansas Rose Office Law Firm, were tasked by President
Clinton to help develop policy for U.S. communications
technology.

According to Foster's secretary, the White House lawyer also had
binders from the NSA in his office.  Binders that were never
turned over by the White House.  White House officials denied
that Foster had any connection with the NSA.  However, documents
forced from the NSA by Washington Weekly and an interview with
former NSA Director Adm. McConnell both confirmed Foster's
presence at Ft. Meade in 1993.

Foster's attendance at Ft. Meade also confirmed that Attorney
General Janet Reno tasked Hubbell to encryption policy.  Hubbell
had access to Top Secret material on U.S. encryption.  This fact
was confirmed by a series of 1997 interviews with Democratic and
Republican staff members in the House.  Congressman Dan Burton
currently holds documents where Hubbell held long meetings with
Foster and now CIA Director George Tenet inside the White House
in 1993.  Burton cannot release those documents because
Democratic members have threatened to walk.

Hubbell was convicted in 1994 for fraud at the same time he was
paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by Indonesian billionaire
Moctar Riady.  Riady and his Lippo group had a great deal of
interest in advanced U.S. technology.  Riady's man inside the
Clinton administration was John Huang at the Brown Commerce
Department.  The Commerce Department asserted in writing in 1997
to this author that John Huang had no encryption documentation.

Yet, the CIA briefed Huang 37 times on satellite encryption
technology while at Commerce.  Huang's co-worker, former DNC
fundraiser Ira Sockowitz, walked out of the Commerce Department
in 1996 with over 2,000 pages of top secret information on
satellite encryption, space launch and earth imaging technology.

Sockowitz was supposed to fly with Brown on the fatal trade trip
but he took an advance flight ahead of the Secretary instead.
Sockowitz identified Ron Brown's body at the crash scene.
Sockowitz left Commerce with the secrets only days after Brown's
death.  He was never prosecuted nor investigated.

One Sockowitz document was so classified that the NSA sent a
representative to testify before Federal Judge Royce Lamberth in
order to keep it secret.  NSA testimony showed that Sockowitz
took a highly classified report based on informants from inside
other countries and inside the U.S.

The list of nations and foreign intelligence services affected
by the leaked report reads like a Rand McNally road map of
secret services around the world.  According to the testimony,
release of the report would affect the "careers" of many foreign
officials.  The last U.S. official who had similar career
problems was convicted spy Johnathan Pollard - now spending life
in prison for passing U.S. encryption secrets to Israel.

Other documents hidden among the Sockowitz files include a
classified series of memos from the Commerce Undersecretary for
Export Administration (BXA) William Reinsch.  The memos detail a
July 1996 Clinton waiver for Loral satellite exports to China
and Russia.  In July 1998, House National Security Committee
Chairman Spence told BXA head Reinsch to produce that memo and
other documents taken by Sockowitz.  So far, the White House and
Reinsch have been unable to comply.

Loral attorneys also claimed to Chairman Rohrabacher of the
House Space Sub-Committee that the million dollars Loral CEO
Schwartz gave to the DNC bought no special favors, and that
Loral passed no military technology to China.

The Loral claims are ridiculous.  Loral's own letters of
complaint to Ron Brown clearly show both claims to be false.
The claim that no military technology was exported is disputed
by Loral's own 1994 briefing memo given to Ron Brown that states
that satellites such as Globalstar were "commercial applications
of DoD technology."

Another example is when Loral DEFENSE President Jerald Lindfelt
wrote Brown a letter in 1996 where he expressed his desire to
sell advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology to
China.  Lindfelt wrote "We've worked hard trying to resolve
these problems with the Department of State, the Department of
Commerce and the Defense Technology Security Administration
(DTSA), but someone in these organizations always manages to
block our participation...  Could you help us by identifying
someone in the Commerce Department high enough in the
organization to help us resolve these issues and open this
marketplace to our participation."

Thus, Loral "Defense" President Lindfelt asked Brown to
over-ride the State Department, the Defense Department and the
Commerce Department to ship a radar system that experts in all
three agencies had objected to.  Only Clinton could do that, and
he took big dollars from Bernard Schwartz.

The claim that Mr. Schwartz received no special favors is almost
laughable.  In 1996 Loral requested that President Clinton hold
up his signature on the Globalstar export waiver so Loral could
include an encrypted satellite telemetry control station for
China.

In 1994 President Clinton arranged for Schwartz to meet Shen
Rong-Jun, Vice Minister of the Chinese Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND).  Of
course, Shen Rong-Jun usually goes by his better known title of
Lt. General Shen Rong-Jun of the People's Liberation Army.
COSTIND, according to the GAO, is "an agency of the Chinese
military (which) oversees development of China's weapon systems
and is responsible for identifying and acquiring
telecommunications technology applicable for military use."

Another example from the files of Ron Brown shows that the wife
of Chinese General Ding Henggao, Madam Nie Li, obtained
permission under a "commercial license" through the Commerce
Department to export an advanced - encrypted - secure fiber
optic communications system to China.  According to the same
documentation, General Ding Henggao is also the Director of
COSTIND.

The same 1996 document notes that Mr. Xie Zhichao, COSTIND
Electronics Design Bureau Director, and communications expert
Deng Changru were part of the executive management for the same
Chinese front company.  Mr. Xie and Mr. Deng also have other
formal titles.  They are both Lt. Colonels in the Chinese Red
Army.  These astonishing facts on Clinton - Chinese Army deals
come directly from the U.S. Commerce Department.

Yet, the Commerce Department claimed on September 1, 1998 that
it cannot "confirm nor deny the existence of any records" in
regard to a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request for
information on "COSTIND".  Furthermore, the Commerce Department
claims "If records were to exist they would be exempt from
disclosure...  unless the release of such information is
determined by the Secretary to be in the national interest."

Obviously, I can confirm that documents on COSTIND exist inside
the Commerce Department.

There is still more evidence the Commerce Department is covering
up crimes committed under Secretary Brown.  For example, in
response to two different FOIA requests, the Commerce Department
returned one trade report twice in 1998.  The first version of
the trade report was heavily blacked out for "commercial" and
"privacy" reasons.  The second, a duplicate of the first,
revealed that Indonesian dictator Suharto had cut his son-in-law
in on a private powerplant deal built and financed by the U.S.
government.  Of course, the U.S. contractor that needed Brown
advocacy to win the deal was also a big donor to the DNC.

The accidentally released 1994 APEC Advocacy trade report spells
out exactly the kind of data being withheld from the U.S.
public.  The report shows the Brown Commerce Department pushed
the power plant despite known corruption and kickbacks.  "ADB is
skiddish about involvement of Indonesia's first family (a
minority shareholder is married to Pres. Suharto's daughter)...
Ambassador Barry has been working with Executive Director Linda
Yang, at the ADB who is 'doing all she can.'"

Another page from the 1994 trade report shows that Commerce
officials were suspicious of Indonesian corruption with French
space companies.  The document notes the intense competition to
win satellite launch contracts for Indonesia between the U.S.
and France included "allegations that the French have paid
'incentive money' to the Indonesians, but this cannot be
confirmed."

Written evidence that American, Indonesian and French taxpayers
were being swindled.  Three governments, spanning three
continents, all involved in one crime.  A trail of evidence
leading to the Commerce Department and to Bill Clinton, all
blacked out in one hidden report from the late Ron Brown.

The ghosts of dead men haunt this government, kept alive by
fresh lies and hidden under blacked out reports.  Evidence on
the transfer of nuclear missile technology to communist China
and kickbacks to the Clinton/Gore campaign.  Despite the
evidence of crimes - the cover-up continues at the Commerce
Department, at Ft. Meade, and inside the White House.
