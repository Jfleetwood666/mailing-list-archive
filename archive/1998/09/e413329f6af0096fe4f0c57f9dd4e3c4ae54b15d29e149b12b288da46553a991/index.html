FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 25, 1997

Attorney General Betty Montgomery Brings New Technology
to Ohio Law Enforcement

Montgomery Gives Computerized Fingerprint Systems
Free of Charge to Help in the Fight Against Crime

Columbus -- In an effort to assist local law enforcement and improve Ohio's
criminal history records, Attorney General Betty D. Montgomery today
announced that 23 law enforcement agencies in Ohio will be receiving
Live-Scan systems at no cost to the agencies.

Through federal grants and money from the Attorney General's budget,
Live-Scan computerized fingerprint identification systems have been
purchased and are being distributed to law enforcement agencies across the
state. The agencies that send the most fingerprint cards to the Ohio Bureau
of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI) were chosen to receive
Live-Scan.

Montgomery was joined by representatives from several law enforcement
agencies that will be receiving Live-Scan systems and local public officials
in announcing this new technology being given to more than 20 law
enforcement agencies.

"I want to thank the Attorney General's Office for this modernized
equipment, which will help law enforcement's advancement in building the
bridge to the 21st century, with technology in crime fighting," said
Franklin County Sheriff Jim Karnes.

Live-Scan provides high-quality electronic fingerprint images through
state-of-the-art computer imaging. Most Ohio law enforcement agencies rely
on the traditional form of using ink to slowly roll each individual
fingerprint onto cards.

With Live-Scan, fingers are placed directly onto a scanner without having to
use ink. The image is stored electronically, and copies of the card can be
printed at any time. This new system will give law enforcement consistently
higher quality fingerprints to use for processing and identification.

These new systems will also electronically send the fingerprint cards to
BCI. This will be an important step in ensuring the quality of Ohio's
criminal history records. BCI will now be able to receive records in a more
timely fashion and virtually eliminate the possibility of records being lost
or not sent. The systems will assist local law enforcement by cutting-down
on the number of hours needed to process fingerprint cards by eliminating
the timely duplicative process of fingerprinting.

The Live-Scan systems will be linked late this fall to BCI's Automated
Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). AFIS is a computer system that
holds the fingerprint images and criminal history records of more than 1.2
million criminals in Ohio. With Live-Scan, law enforcement agencies will be
able to quickly search AFIS for matches to their fingerprint cards. This
will be extremely useful if someone with a prior record tries to give an
alias or refuses to disclose his or her name. The agency can scan the
suspect's fingerprints and check them against the database at BCI for a
match.

"Here's the bottom line: This technology will allow police to identify
criminals faster and more accurately than anything even dreamed of just
years ago," Montgomery said.

The Live-Scan systems were purchased for almost $1.1 million from Identix
Inc. of California. Ohio is joining the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the U.S. Marshal, and numerous
other federal agencies, states, and cities that have also purchased
Live-Scan systems from Identix Inc. Each system retails for $70,000 but the
Attorney General was able to negotiate a purchase price for a much lower
cost of $44,220.

Law enforcement agencies that already have Live-Scan systems and meet
requirements of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will be
connected with Ohio's AFIS as part of the contract with Identix Inc. The
contract also allows any local law enforcement agency to purchase a
Live-Scan system within the next year at the same price negotiated by the
Attorney General.

Attorney General Montgomery also announced that her office plans to purchase
additional Live-Scan systems in the beginning of next year to be distributed
to more law enforcement agencies across the state.
