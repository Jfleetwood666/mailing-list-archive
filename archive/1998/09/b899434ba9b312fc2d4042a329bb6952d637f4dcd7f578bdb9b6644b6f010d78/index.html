This is the most INCREDIBLE article.  I never thought I'd read something
like this in the mainstream media!!! -Jean


                   The virtual president=20
                 =20

                   By Missy Kelly=20
                   Copyright 1998, WorldNetDaily.com=20

                   "You know, by the time you become the leader of a
                   country, someone else makes all the decisions." -- Bill
                   Clinton September 4, 1998=20

                   Well, shut my mouth. The president of the United
                   States admits publicly that he is the puppet of larger
                   powers -- that "someone else," in fact, "makes all the
                   decisions."=20

                   Of course, those who understand how power really
                   works in this nation recognize the veracity of his
                   statement immediately. But for Bill to state it so openly
                   is truly remarkable -- not just for its honesty, but for
its
                   recklessness.=20

                   In a glib and Freudian moment, it just slipped out.=20

                   It appears Bill is "getting it."=20

                   Clinton was reminded the week of Aug. 25 that The
                   Agenda Transcended the Man. He was given a
                   heads-up that his removal from office would have to
                   happen. The New York Times intoned, "But if there is
                   no hope for the agenda, what need is there for the
                   man?" Garry Wills also called for his resignation,
                   writing, "[Clinton] would be saying that the goals he
                   fought for are more important than personal pride or
                   prerogatives." Other former sycophants in the press
                   piped up using minor variations of the same
                   phraseology: Clinton should resign because the
                   "agenda" transcends the man. The Agenda is
                   paramount.=20

                   Yet, Bill still didn't "get it" -- that in his pact with
the
                   devil, the devil held the upper hand. In typical Bill
                   psycho-fashion, he thought he could once again charm
                   his way out of removal; and make a "show of force" to
                   prove to his masters that he still had the right stuff to
                   salvage his career and continue with the Agenda. To
                   that end, his White House staff -- a separate operation
                   from the power brokers -- was told by Bill to pull out
                   all stops to save his presidency.=20

                   But suddenly there were leaks to the Washington Post
                   that there were more bimbos than just Monica in Bill's
                   White House closets. "I never had an affair with the
                   President, but all the others who have get to stay,"
                   Monica allegedly whined to Clinton aide Marsha Scott
                   while pleading to be returned to a White House
                   position.=20

                   More forcefully, the power brokers served Bill notice
                   that their demands for removal were to be taken
                   seriously when the Department of Justice, out of the
                   blue, announced that the President himself -- Bill
                   Clinton -- was the subject of a NEW 90-day
                   investigation into campaign donation illegalities. On
                   three -- count 'em -- three separate prior occasions,
                   Attorney General Janet Reno had formally investigated
                   such charges and declared there was "nothing there."
                   Publicly, no new information had come to light, but
                   suddenly there was the alarming notion that there was
                   a "there, there" and it involved Bill Clinton himself.=20

                   The message: Bill, you will do what we tell you. We
                   can do this the easy way or the hard way. Start
                   packing your bags. Bill is "getting it," now.=20

                   Bill is resigning himself to his resignation.=20

                   The President has not yet identified for us who this
                   "someone else" is who really puppets the highest office
                   of our land. So for purposes of discussion, let's just
                   give them an identifier. Borrowing from John LeCarre's
                   "The Night Manager," let's call them "Flagship."=20

                   Flagship, of course, knows not only where all the
                   bodies are buried -- literally and figuratively -- but=
 has
                   the wherewithal to pick through them all, choosing one
                   misdeed after another, exposing them one by one until
                   Bill relents. It's blackmail. And blackmail works unless
                   you handle it in the manner Rep. Dan Burton has in the
                   past couple of days. Bill Clinton is incapable -- truly
                   incapable -- of doing what Burton did. Truly.=20

                   "You may find you can get away with virtual
                   presidents, virtual prime ministers, virtual everything."
                   -- Bill Clinton, September 4, 1998=20

                   This is another Freudian lament, verbalized by a Bill
                   Clinton who finally "gets it." He was and is the
                   VIRTUAL PRESIDENT. By his own admission, he
                   was a front, with no power to make decisions. By his
                   own admission, they were made for him, by "someone
                   else." They were made by those whom Flagship had
                   placed in lower level, under-the-radar positions within
                   the cabinet. They didn't even have to ask Bill's
                   permission. They got their orders, and implemented
                   them.=20

                   Bill's job was to pretend -- pretend he was the leader,
                   pretend he was in charge -- maintain the fa=E7ade of a
                   "virtual" president in a "virtual" democracy where a
                   "virtual" rule of law exists. In fact, the levers of=
 power
                   were already controlled -- controlled so precisely, in
                   fact, as to make the president irrelevant, controlled by
                   people who have never been elected to office, and
                   whose names we do not even know.=20

                   Flagship cannot afford impeachment hearings. There is
                   an Agenda, and a timeline that must be maintained. It is
                   of utmost importance that the new leader be installed
                   immediately. Therefore, I would not be surprised if Bill
                   is gone within two weeks or less.=20

                   If you consider Bill's virtual presidency, you know the
                   words he spoke are true. He was so much a puppet
                   that he even dispensed with the appearance of
                   business. He cut off daily briefings, which every other
                   president attended. He lengthened the time between
                   other regularly scheduled meetings. He hardly ever
                   meets -- or even talks -- to his cabinet members.
                   Recall Warren Christopher, the first Secretary of
                   State, and William Perry, the Secretary of Defense,
                   expressing extreme frustration that they could not get a
                   meeting with the president, even in times of crisis.=20

                   Instead, poor, useless Bill was busy playing golf,
                   jogging, or on one of his many, many vacations.
                   Having his weekly dinners with his Arkie crowd,
                   screening new movies, attending fundraisers at the
                   pace of 30 a month, playing host to a legion of Lincoln
                   bedroom guests, and having coffee with drug
                   smugglers, arms dealers, terrorists, communists and
                   crony capitalists. In between, he was juggling his many
                   women, coordinating their liaisons and cover stories.
                   Plus all that time he devoted to considering how he
                   could provide answers that were "legally correct" but
                   "misleading" in all of his many scandals. Phew, I am
                   exhausted just thinking about it.=20

                   How many times have we said during this presidency
                   -- who is really running this country when we have a
                   president who is missing in action? Time and again, it
                   was apparent that Bill Clinton was not on task doing
                   presidential duties. But for him to admit it, openly --
                   whoa! Surely he doesn't think his scorched earth
                   policy extends to his masters, does he? Is he truly so
                   arrogant that he thinks he can take them down, too, in
                   a child-like temper tantrum? If so, he is truly playing
                   with fire. But I suspect, no. Bill may have harbored
                   those thoughts last week, but is seeing the light, now.
                   His unguarded comments were purely Freudian
                   meanderings of the mind.=20

                   Clinton made the reckless error of speaking his
                   thoughts out loud. As stupid as this was, it is not so
                   surprising. It is intimately a part of this man's sick
                   psychology that he would want to provide excuses for
                   his problems outside of himself -- to explain that it
                   really isn't his fault. After all, I don't really have=
 any
                   power -- I am a virtual president. I am not to blame. I
                   am a victim -- I was just doing what I was told.=20

                   Bill has always been a victim of someone else, and
                   never responsible for his own actions. As we pull our
                   love away from him, it becomes ever so much more
                   important to his psyche that he win us over. He can't
                   help himself. He must explain, and win us back.
                   Biographers have often noted that Clinton would be in
                   a room full of adoring fans, and one person who wasn't
                   enthralled. Clinton would devote all his energy to
                   charming that one person. There is pathology to this
                   man that is ingrained. Without reflected adoration,
                   there is no Bill Clinton. He ceases to exist.=20

                   But if he doesn't contain himself, and stop trying to
                   make public excuses that touch this close to the heart
                   of power in this nation, he's putting himself in extreme
                   jeopardy. Flagship must be assured that Clinton will
                   never expose his masters and the Agenda. And this is
                   a real fear -- they, too, understand the psyche of Bill
                   Clinton.=20

                   When Bill resigns, he will have to go deeply off the
                   radar screen -- I mean no mention of him. Disappear.
                   There can be no distractions as the Agenda barges
                   forward. But Bill's psyche cannot tolerate this -- his
                   must have sycophants and lovers -- he is no one
                   without the human mirror of his success. I remind you
                   of what happened to him after he lost the governor's
                   race in Arkansas 20 years ago. Study that period. This
                   was a pathetic man, deep in depression, who
                   approached perfect strangers and asked them why
                   they hadn't voted for him. It conjures up visions of a
                   former President calling up Larry King Live and
                   blathering on that he's lonely and misunderstood, ala
                   O.J. Simpson.=20

                   Flagship cannot afford a Bill Clinton behaving this way,
                   and possibly exposing their Agenda. Therefore, I
                   suspect that not only will Bill Clinton be removed from
                   office -- i.e. forced to resign -- before the end of
                   September, but I also strongly fear that Bill will commit
                   Arkancide within the year.=20

                   Bill was always in "the game" for Bill. Hillary was
                   always in this for the Agenda. She has always believed
                   that the Agenda transcended the man, which is why
                   she has always put up with -- beyond rational
                   endurance -- Bill's shenanigans. She knew from the
                   get-go that they were the chosen ones, part of a select
                   stable from whom the anointed, the "someone else" Bill
                   referred to, would choose to lead us into convergence,
                   the Third Way. This Third Way is part of a long-term
                   strategy that was developed 40 years ago.=20

                   Knowing this, Hillary stuck with Bill because her
                   allegiance -- above all else -- has always been to the
                   Agenda. And because this is still true, she cannot
                   possibly stay with Bill now that he has become a
                   liability. To cheers and salutations, she will divorce=
 Bill
                   Clinton shortly after he resigns, and no one will blink
                   an eye. She will divorce him not because he's "done
                   her wrong" but because he is no longer useful. Then
                   Hillary, in all her glory, will be unleashed on this=
 world.
                   She will have her own, not reflected, power most likely
                   as Queen of the World through her new U.N. position.
                   Maybe things aren't looking so bad for Hillary, after
                   all.=20

                   Rahm Emanuel, in continuing his attacks against
                   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr last week invoked
                   the ghost of military strategist Karl Von Clausewitz.=20

                   "Clausewitz [sic] said war is an extension of politics,
                   by other means." Odd. A former ballet dancer a
                   student of Von Clausewitz?=20

                   Would you agree that the Clintons and their supporters
                   resort to all sorts of stratagems, maneuvers, illegal
                   methods, evasions and subterfuge to achieve their
                   objectives?=20

                   Would you?=20

                   Does the record of their actions comport with that
                   statement?=20

                   Hmmm?=20

                   Those are the exact words of Lenin, when he laid out
                   his plans for global communism.=20

                   analyst.=20
