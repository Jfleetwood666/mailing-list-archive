Underwood 

More than 40 years ago Armand [bunky] Larive, I, and others took
history of philosphy from bill soper.

Laivre is an an episcopal priest in Pullman now.
http://www.web-x.com/wazzu.net/restaurantguide/index.html

I don't see sopher listed in the faculty directory.
http://people.whitman.edu/faculty_homepages.html

Sopher invited an attractive articulate lady from the B'Hai religion
to lecture our class.

The LADY put forth an argument on why we should all believe.

In the next lecture Soper, as a philospher should, went into 
every detail why her arguments were falacious.

           The contemplation of things as they are,       
                without error or confusion,       
            without substitution or imposture,       
   is in itself a nobler thing than a whole harvest of invention.       
       
   Francis Bacon        


I think Lairve was present at the lecture and analysis.

I PROFITED FROM YOUR differential equations AND 
elementary mathematics from an advanced standpoint courses.
But this has been about 40 years ago.

I still have the books used in your classes.

And my education at Whitman.

Then, too, I profited from Zirakzaheh's higher alegraba course in the 
summer of 1958 at U Colorado.

Let's hope this gets settled before someone gets NUKED.

We know these guys. http://www.wpiran.org/  http://www.taliban.com/
http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/impact/namir/namirm.html

And we SPECULATE that they are NOT HAPPY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

CHRYSLER AWARD NOMINATION STATEMENT
                                9/16/9812:50 PM
                        
American forefathers drafted the Constitution and laws of our country
shortly after having suffered injustice.   
Fresh in their minds were strategies used by their oppressors.  Writers
of the Constitution and laws anticipated 
ways to subvert our system.  Therefore, our forefathers designed
safeguards into our legal system to prevent 
future injustice.

But these safeguards DON'T appear to be working today.

Morales and Payne designed a strategy using the National Security Agency
[NSA], Sandia National 
Laboratories, the US Federal Court System, and publication on Internet
to illustrate how the US government 
has deteriorated.

Arthur Morales WAS a supervisor at Sandia Labs in 1991.  Morales and
Manuel Garcia organized a class 
action lawsuit on behalf of Hispanics against Sandia.

Sandia settled Morales' and Garcia's lawsuit.  Department of Energy
acknowledged from Freedom of 
Information Act  [FOIA] requests that as of  December 31, 1995 Morales
cost Sandia $567,137 in legal fees.

Sandia retaliated against Morales.  Morales sued Sandia in New Mexico
District Court.  Morales lost.

William Payne wrote a technical report describing 'deficiencies'  in
NSA's cryptographic algorithms 
http://jya.com/da/whpda.htm.  Sandia transferred Payne to break
electronics locks for the Federal Bureau of 
Invesitgation [FBI].  Payne refused to do illegal work. 
http://www.jya.com/whp1.htm.

Payne sued Sandia in Federal Court.  Payne lost and court records were
sealed.

FBI agent Bernardo Perez  led a class action lawsuit against the FBI for
race discrimination against Hispanic
FBI agents.  http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/1995/w951482w.txt

Perez won.  Perez was assigned agent-in-charge of the FBI in Albuquerque
for settlement.  But Perez lost
money.

Morales and Payne learned that the FBI extorted an inexpensive
settlement from Perez by telling Perez that the FBI was GUARANTEED to
win on appeal in Federal Circuit.

With Perez' and others knowledge of circuit courts, Morales and Payne
appealed their respective cases pro se 
to the Tenth Circuit.  

In Payne's case Sandia failed to submit its Brief of the Appellees on
time.  Then falsified its certificate of 
service when Payne filed to remand.

In Morales' case Sandia submitted a deficient Brief of the Appellees
which was returned but failed to serve 
Morales with its  brief.

Payne and Morales both won at the Tenth Circuit on technicalities.  But
judges awarded the wins to Sandia.

All attempts by Morales and Payne to get copies of the docket for their
respective Tenth Circuit cases failed.

Therefore, Morales and Payne hatched a plan to get the dockets and
expose government misconduct.  

Payne previously made FOIA requests to NSA for  copies of messages and
translations given to 
Iraq during the Iraq/Iran war, copies of Libyan messages intercepted by
NSA, and NSA cryptographic
algorithms Payne thought contained deficiencies.

Morales and Payne sued NSA pro se for the documents. Lawsuit progress
was broadcast on Internet through e-
mail and

     http://www.aci.net/kalliste/speccoll.htm
     http://jya.com/whpfiles.htm

And Payne wrote

 Black and White Test of Cryptographic Algorithms

criticizing the US government's crypto contest.  http://zolatimes.com.

Morales and Payne FINALLY got copies of dockets from their respective
cases from the Tenth
Circuit using Internet as an innovative tool.

Hi Biru,

&gt; In
&gt; 
&gt;  Non-random Cryptographic Keys Defeat Key Escrow
&gt; 
&gt; I will introduce, by example, readers to deBruijn diagrams and
&gt; statistical tests.
&gt; Both will be related to random number and pseudorandom number
&gt; generation.

Sounds good to us.  

We know mathematics scares our readers.  But some of our 
editors like it just fine.  And we don't care much for
the Great Satan around here.

Cheers,

Z
