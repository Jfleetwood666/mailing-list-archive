    careful, Bob --they'll be saying this reeks of another
    philosophical argument which has two CPers MIA.

    Big Brother is watching the list --or at least the IRS-CID is.

	attila out...

    P.S. BTW, IMNSOHO, good fiction and worth the read!

&gt;
&gt;It's Sunday and there's a hurricane coming.  We're prepared
&gt;with the Pringles and Jamaican ginger beer, and are now just
&gt;watching the action on screen and out the window.
&gt;
&gt;One of the things about living in the Financial Cryptography
&gt;Capital of the World is that occasionally we get visited by
&gt;The Powers That Be, and flattened in the process.
&gt;
&gt;More nuisance than a TLA hate campaign, noisier than
&gt;professors' mailing list, and more water than a broken
&gt;pipe in a Cyber.  Hurricane Georges is coming to town.
&gt;
&gt;The funny thing is that all along, or at least for many
&gt;years, we have known how to control hurricanes.  It was
&gt;inevitably one of those cold war US defence contracts, run
&gt;by the USAF.  There was some justification based on annoying
&gt;naval flotillas at sea, although it wasn't clear whether the
&gt;fly-boys were intending to annoy the USN or the Ruskies.
&gt;They kept the whole thing quiet, as nobody needs to know that
&gt;huge amounts of money can be saved and/or advancing armardas
&gt;can be sunk without using the other expensive toys developed
&gt;by the other programs.
&gt;
&gt;Trials did occur, but the technology failed to make it into
&gt;the commercial market.  In order to hide the true potential,
&gt;the brass hats put a strict 56-miles limit on the application
&gt;for civilian purposes, thus revealing that you could only move
&gt;the beast around, you couldn't really tame it.
&gt;
&gt;The real problem with the technology was that hurricanes still
&gt;wanted to go in roughly the same direction, and all one could
&gt;do was to pay the fee to the Air Force to get it moved 56 miles
&gt;up or down the coast.  Needless to say, the Generals were
&gt;surprised to receive competing bids for services in the first
&gt;live civilian hurricane.
&gt;
&gt;After a lot of confusion and multiple contradictory bids being
&gt;accepted, the hurricane entered, destroyed, and left.  As did
&gt;the Generals, with the loot.  This misuse of what were now public
&gt;funds was considered sufficient to slap the exec order on the
&gt;whole deal, conveniently making illegal any class action suits
&gt;over the misused private funds.
&gt;
&gt;Working on this problem for some time has led to a solution.
&gt;Using an anonymous cash protocol, we have built an Internet-based
&gt;solution for setting the market-driven price for a hurricane path.
&gt;Conveniently, we have also contracted delivery services from the
&gt;specialists, those very same Generals, who are now living in the
&gt;islands near here under assumed names and ranks.
&gt;
&gt;Up until now, the whole idea was received with less than religous
&gt;fervour.  Either nobody believed we could do it, or the locals
&gt;were simply playing on island time.  Just as we were about to give
&gt;it up and retire to banana growing, Georges showed up and contracts
&gt;started winding in.
&gt;
&gt;Market operators have a duty to track activity and ensure
&gt;that no insider trading occurs (those pesky Generals).  This
&gt;responsibility has expanded into advice for traders of attractive
&gt;opportunities for investment, either in the future positions
&gt;market or in our line of lamps, air-dropped generators, and
&gt;emergency supplies of Pringles.
&gt;
&gt;We've also been able to track geographical trends for governmental
&gt;statistical purposes.  Georges was nominally slated to cross the
&gt;islands at Guadeloupe, but heavy market pressure backed by church
&gt;collections on thursday night purchased a shift north in track.
&gt;Getting in early was profitable for the Guadeloupians.
&gt;
&gt;St Martins then bought heavily and shifted it back on a close
&gt;to due east track.   Unfortunately the French fluffed it last night
&gt;by downgrading their alert to a warning, so all the world knows now.
&gt;
&gt;Antigua, being stuck in the middle, then bought in, backed up by
&gt;Monsterrat (who raised funds by threatening the Brits with another
&gt;thousand refugees).  Since then Georges has been yoyoing across the
&gt;map and the market has gone to hell in a hand basket.
&gt;
&gt;The Generals had been raking in the delivery contracts, but have
&gt;posted an aircraft maintainance alert and tripled the premium.
&gt;
&gt;Antiguan alternate government types, engaged in a power play
&gt;with their legal counterparts, have traded a mammoth contract to
&gt;have the hurricane move _towards_ them.  Unhappy at the Generals'
&gt;reluctance to fly, they've issued an options contract of another
&gt;kind on the market operators, that will be 'in the money' if their
&gt;other contract is not fulfilled.
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, a catholic mama in the US virgin islands had a little
&gt;flutter on the market to help her more easterly daughter.
&gt;
&gt;Failing to spot mama's anonymous currency transaction form, the IRS have
&gt;declared the area in general and hurricanes in particular to be a major
&gt;money laundering effort, and have a SWOT team flying in.  At least, the
&gt;men in black will fly in once they complete negotiations with the Generals,
&gt;who previously contracted all airports for the hurricane season, and
&gt;are prepared to deal in exchange for an amnesty for previous picadillos.
&gt;
&gt;The market still goes strong, having at this stage traded 10% of
&gt;the GDP of the East Caribbean.  We're prepared for the long run,
&gt;with defense in depth by redundant UPS and generators, multiple IP
&gt;and interlocking 50 cal machine guns.  If only we could stop our
&gt;shareholders from killing each other, we could advance our plans
&gt;to open trading in Florida.
&gt;
&gt;Phew.  This Jamaican ginger beer is strong stuff, and we're already
&gt;out of Pringles.  Oh, and there's a hurricane coming.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;El Generalissimo.
