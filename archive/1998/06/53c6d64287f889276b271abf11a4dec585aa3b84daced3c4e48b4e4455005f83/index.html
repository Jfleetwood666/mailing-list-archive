HI. I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS INTRUSION ,    
BUT YOU MAY THANK ME FOR THIS .

COULD YOU USE AN EXTRA $ 25,000  NEXT WEEK  ? 
                                  
THEN  GIVE ME ONE MINUTE OF  YOUR TIME...   

IT MIGHT  BE WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS   

Dear Friend, 

My name is David Ross and I need YOU.

Let me explain

I reside in an island paradise . I entertain on a 75 ft. yacht . 
I travel the world by private lear jet .
I drive 8 cars including two Ferraris,  a Rolls Royce Corniche 
and a 1955 gull wing Mercedes worth over a million dollars. 
I party with supermodels , world famous celebrities and diplomats.
Banks are constantly trying to lend me money at prime rates..
but I don't need them any more. 

However, it wasn't always like this.

Until 1995 I was working for the telephone company .
I drove a 1989 Chrysler LeBaron and had over $50,000 
in revolving debt.
It seemed that I would never get ahead and was doomed 
to be a loser .

In my spare time I studied every money making system out there.
In fact , I often ordered 10 new money making systems a month.
I guess this is one of the main reasons I was so over extended 
on my credit cards.
You could say that my single obsession was investigating profit systems .

Then , one day , I was doing research on grants at the library.
I accidentally discovered something that all the B.S.money making books 
never mentioned  This simple discovery brought in:
$1,876.89  FOR THREE HOURS WORK !

Over the next 5 weeks , 
I proved to myself that this method worked 
time after time....EVERY TIME !  
Then , at the beginning of the next month, 
I opened my bank statement. 
My jaw dropped opened to discover that there was

$ 265,832.91  IN MY CHECKING ACCOUNT ! 

I had discovered  a secret program  
that virtually forced people to give me money ! 

After a period of  11 incredibly exciting months , 
I discovered that I had made

$ 1,454,742.39   
working about three hours per night from home.

All without spending a dime on office rent or employees, 
and while keeping my current job.....
which I soon quit after many  years 
( to hell with the pension and benefits ) . 
Then I made another exciting break through !  
I thought,

" WOW.... ANYBODY COULD DO THIS..
   IF THEY ONLY KNEW HOW ! "

This has lead me to an even faster and easier way 
to get richer : WORKING WITH PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU ! 
I am going to help a few others 
DO EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS I HAVE DONE ! 
AND PROFIT RIGHT ALONG WITH YOU FROM 
YOUR OWN POWERFUL RESULTS !
I've  developed a comprehensive , easy to understand  
PRIVATE REPORT .  A complete

STEP BY STEP , FOOLPROOF BLUEPRINT   
FOR YOUR VERY OWN PERSONAL CASH MACHINE

is just like having a legal printing press to  

MAKE SERIOUS MONEY ANYTIME YOU WANT !  
SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS   WORK FROM HOME ,

Are you skeptical ? I understand. So was I ..at first.
SO PLEASE ... DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.    
SEE FOR YOURSELF  

TEST IT OUT     ABSOLUTELY RISK FREE !
 In fact..you  WILL be completely convinced that this system
WILL make you at least 10,000 times what you paid for the report 
or I'll send you your money back..
NO QUESTIONS ASKED . EVEN ONE YEAR LATER .

GUARANTEED  .   

Frankly, I don't know why anybody would want to waste  time
 .....but I am that confident. 
Take a full year to TEST THIS SYSTEM 
and if you're not 100 % SATISFIED 
during your one year NO RISK TRIAL...
 I' LL SIMPLY REFUND EVERY PENNY TO YOU.
