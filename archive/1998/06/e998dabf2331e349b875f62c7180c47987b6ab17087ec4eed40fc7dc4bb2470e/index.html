Dear One Nation supporters

Toyota are the bona-fide sponsors of Sixty Minutes. 

Further to our email yesterday about their coverage of Pauline Hanson
tonight, ****I would encourage**** you to take a moment to send your message
of concern about the unethical behaviour of this Channel 9 programme and
express yours views clearly on how you feel this might reflect on their
business.

Here is Toyota's email address:

Here is a copy of the email sent to you yesterday from Pauline Hanson:

NEWS RELEASE

6/6/98
60 minutes' Fairytales

"This Sunday, 60 Minutes is airing a segment devoted to connecting
Pauline Hanson with individuals or groups in the United States. While we
don't know who these people are, what is certain is that Pauline Hanson
is not in contact politically or organisationally with anyone in the
United States - the 60 Minutes story is a fairytale.

After hearing of an advertisement for this Sunday's 60 minutes, David
Oldfied contacted the programme to check its content. Despite making it
clear there was absolutely no communication between Pauline Hanson, her
advisers, or the organisation's heads and anyone in the United States,
60 minutes refused to even consider they had manufactured the story.
They also refused to allow One Nation an opportunity to rebut their
fairytale until the programme the following week. This is a nefariously
timed lie. 

This is deceptive and dishonest journalism at its worst and all credible
journalists, whatever their personal feelings, should be appalled at 60
minutes' approach. Regardless of what evidence 60 Minutes produce or
what they may state, the whole story is a fairytale fabricated without
the slightest basis of truth. There is no connection or communication
between the United States and Pauline Hanson or One Nation.

While we have no knowledge of such activities, it is possible some
individual member may be in contact with people overseas but this, if it
has happened, is a personal affair and unrelated to us as an
organisation.

It should also be understood that One Nation letterhead and other
documents have been forged on a number of occasions. Further to this,
people have falsely claimed to be party officials and candidates as well
as one incident where a person in Western Australia claimed to be a
close personal adviser to Pauline when in fact she had never even met
him.

We are not sure what 60 minutes will put to air, but having spoken to
them twice, it is clear they will peddle the lie of links that simply do
not exist. Perhaps they have cleverly manufactured a fairytale with the
help of people either willing to perjure themselves or who are just not
aware they are not really in contact with Pauline or One Nation, but
whatever the case, their story is fiction in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
degree.

60 minute's refusal of an opportunity for us to face their fairytale on
their programme this Sunday night, in itself, proves their intention to
simply maliciously attack Pauline and One Nation by any means regardless
of the total lack of truth. 60 minutes has no credibility and should be
treated accordingly. Even their Internet story announcing their
programme is filled with lies when factual evidence is clearly available
by speaking to us, something they chose not to do because the truth
would ruin their dishonest and despicable claims."   

"Pauline Hanson and One Nation is, and will always be, 100% Australian
owned and 100% Australian influenced."

Statement issued by request of Pauline Hanson MP.
