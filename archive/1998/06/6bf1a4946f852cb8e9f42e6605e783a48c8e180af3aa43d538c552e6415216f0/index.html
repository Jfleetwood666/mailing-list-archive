		Last Call For Participation - RAID 98

      (also available at http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~dac/RAID98)

   First International Workshop on the Recent Advances in Intrusion
			      Detection

	   September 14-15, 1998 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium

We solicit your participation in the first International Workshop on the 
Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID 98). 

This workshop, the first in an anticipated annual series, will bring 
together leading figures from academia, government, and industry to talk 
about the current state of intrusion detection technologies and paradigms 
from the research and commercial perspectives. 

Research into and development of automated intrusion detection systems 
(IDS) has been under way for nearly 10 years. By now a number of systems 
have been deployed in the commercial or government arenas, but all are 
limited in what they do. At the same time, the numerous research and 
prototype systems developed have been more engineering than scientific 
efforts, with scant quantitative performance figures. As we survey the 
field of automated intrusion detection, we are faced with many questions: 

1.	What research questions have yet to be answered (or even
        asked) about IDS? 
2.	What are the open challenges, limitations, and fundamental
        concerns about present intrusion detection methodologies? 
3.	What metrics can we use to measure IDS performance and thus 
        compare different systems and methodologies? These
        measurements should highlight the successes and expose the
        limitations of current IDS approaches. 
4.	What factors are inhibiting transfer of research ideas into 
        functional deployed systems? How can those be addressed? 
5.	What is the role of a deployed IDS? How should or can it fit in 
        with other security systems? 
6.	What are the typical IDS operating environments? What can be 
        done to configure IDS to unique operating environments?
7.	What are the challenges for IDS in very large environments, such 
        as the Internet? 
8.	Is it time to contemplate IDS standards? What are the advantages
        and disadvantages of standardizing components of IDS?
        What forums (e.g., IETF, ISO) would be appropriate for
        pursuing such standards? 
9.	What are the problems of turning the results of intrusion
        detection tools into legally reliable evidence? What are the
        problems of admissibility and of courtroom presentation? 

We invite proposals and panels that explore these questions or any other 
aspect of automated intrusion detection. We especially solicit proposals 
and panels that address: 

1.	New results related to intrusion detection methodologies and 
        technologies. 
2.	Innovative ways of thinking about intrusion detection; for 
        example, the applicability of R&amp;D in the fields of survivable
        and/or dependable systems, data mining, etc. 
3.	User experiences and lessons learned from fielded intrusion 
        detection systems. 
4.	IDS for emerging computer environments (e.g., Java, CORBA, and 
        NT). 
5.      Commercial intrusion detection systems.

We have scheduled RAID 98 immediately before ESORICS 98, at the same time 
as CARDIS 98, and at the same location as both of these conferences. This 
provides a unique opportunity for the members of these distinct, yet 
related, communities to participate in all these events and meet and share 
ideas during joined organized external events.

SUBMISSIONS
***********

The program committee invites proposals for both technical and general 
interest talks and panels.

Each talk or panel submission must contain:

1)  A separate title page with:
      The type of submission (talk or panel);
      The title or topic; and
      The name(s) of the speaker or panel chair and probable
      panelists, with their organizational affiliation(s), telephone
      and FAX numbers, postal address, and Internet electronic mail
      address.
2)  A brief biography of each participant.
3)  The time desired for the talk or panel.

Talk proposals must also include an abstract that is a maximum of 600 
words in length. Papers are not required, but if included as an addendum, 
will be used as supplementary information for the evaluation of the talk 
proposal. The program committee will allocate each accepted presenter 
either a 15 or 30-minute slot for the talk, based on the complexity and 
interest of the proposed topic and the wishes of the speaker. The 
presenter will be informed the slot length when notified of acceptance.

Panel proposals must also include a description that is a maximum of 300 
words, the format of the presentation, and short rationale for the panel. 
The program committee will allocate accepted panel sessions one to 
two-hour time slots, based on the complexity and interest of the proposed 
topic, the number of panelists, and the wishes of the panel chair. The 
panel chair will be informed the slot length when notified of acceptance.

All proposals must be in English. Plan to give all panels and talks in 
English. 

We must receive all proposals before June 15, 1998. We strongly prefer 
they be submitted by e-mail to raid98@zurich.ibm.com. Various formats 
(ASCII, postscript, Word, WordPro, Framemaker, and LaTex) are acceptable. 
If necessary, hardcopy proposals may be sent to:
