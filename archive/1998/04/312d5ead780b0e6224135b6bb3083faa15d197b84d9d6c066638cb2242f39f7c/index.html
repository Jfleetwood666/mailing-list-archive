Are you interested in making an extra $10,000, $50,000, or 
$100,000 a month?

YES! $100,000 a month.  If you believe that someday you'll get 
that big break, get ready because THIS IS IT!  Just imagine, no
more living from paycheck to paycheck. Become FINANCIALLY
INDEPENDENT. Buy your dream home. Purchase that sports car in 
cash. Never again worry about living in debt.

"I currently make $1,350 to $1,800 a day doing this part-time. 
One week after I started, the checks showed up in my mailbox. I 
can't believe it!" - Lynette from Glendale, CA.

I'm sure you've seen couples on TV, sitting on a couch, holding 
each other's hand &amp; claiming to make this sort of MONEY. If all 
these people were lying, don't you think you would have heard 
about it from the Attorney General or Hard Copy? STOP thinking 
that no one can possibly make this kind of money. WE ARE!!

"I was probably the most skeptical person out there, until I saw 
how much my brother-in-law was making. Then I HAD to try it.  The 
first day, I got checks that totaled $5,693. Yesterday I made 
$4,374." - Michael from Everette, WA

MAKE HUGE PROFITS IN THE INFORMATION AGE
Selling information is one of the FASTEST and EASIEST ways to get 
into the mail order business. Ordinary people just like you and 
me are doing this and smiling all the way to the bank. It is only 
in this amazing business can you start out with practically NO 
CAPITAL and with literally NO LIMIT to your profits.

I bet you know someone who would PAY YOU $5-$15 to know:
HOW TO GET $1,000,000 WORTH OF LIFE INSURANCE WITH NO CASH!
HOW TO STOP PAYING PROPERTY TAXES ON YOUR HOME
WIPE OUT DEBTS WITHOUT BANKRUPTCY
INSIDER SECRETS TO PERSONAL TAX SHELTERS
HOW TO REDUCE YOUR GROCERY BILLS BY 50%
TOP 10 WAYS TO MAKE MONEY ON THE INTERNET

All you have to do is buy our CD-ROM which contain over 650+ how
To money making reports, reprint on diskettes or paper &amp; SELL,
SELL, SELL.  CD-ROM comes with Unlimited Reprint &amp; Resell 
license.  You can sell the reports individually or in sets 
through classified ads,personal contacts, flyers, or on the Net. 
 
Sell them HOWEVER you want and for as MUCH as you want. 
YOU KEEP ALL THE PROFIT.

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it 
goes, and you send out only 2,000 email ads a day. (You obviously 
already have an internet connection so e-mail advertising is
FREE.)  Your email would read:

*****************************************************
* SPECIAL REPORT
* "Live in a $100,000 Home without ANY Money" 
* Send $10 &amp; self-addressed stamped envelope to:
* YOUR NAME
* YOUR ADDRESS
* YOUR CITY AND STATE
*****************************************************

Let's also say that the mailing only receives a tiny response 
rate of not  5% , not 1% but 0.5%. That comes out to 10 orders a 
day X $10.00 per order. That's $100 in additional income a day 
for 5 minutes of work. Imagine, that comes out to an additional 
$36,500 a year. Can you use an extra $36,500 a year for 5 minutes 
of work?

BUT what would happen if you sent out 100,000 emails? At the 
smaller response rate of  0.35% , YOU WILL EARN $105,000.00 OF 
SPENDABLE CASH IN JUST ONE MONTH!

Note: Some programs out there send email at 250,000 - 330,000 
emails an HOUR with a 28.8 modem.

Note: Currently there are over 90 million email accounts users &amp; 
predicted to be 500 million by the year 2000
