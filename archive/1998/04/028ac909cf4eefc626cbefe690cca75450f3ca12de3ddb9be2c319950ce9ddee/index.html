Introducing "7MG's" Golden Portfolio and the amazing    
7 MILLION DOLLAR GENERATOR!!!!

Make all your financial dreams come true within a 
few weeks!

5 people= $7,000,000!!!

The Golden Portfolio/"7-Million-Dollar-List" is a completely 
new,  revolutionary income opportunity which allows everyone
to achieve financial success with very little effort and only a 
small one-time stake. 

The GP"7-Million-Dollar-List" concept is extremely simple yet 
brilliant in it's ability to create profits for all participants with a 
logical and ingenious system. This system is cheat-proof and 
assures fast payments to all participants. There is no waiting
for company checks as all payments received are money orders..
straight to you!

No complicated spillovers, matrixes or other MLM non-sense.
This is a simple program which requires no work other than
the 10 steps listed below. 

The program is legal in that a product is exchanged for the
$160, a portfolio of information on such topics as effective
marketing, travel discounts, anonymous bank accounts etc.
7MG will deliver the product to your customers and monitor
the program to assure that you will get your payments sent
directly to you for a one time $20 fee.

How does it work?

There are seven positions on the  GP"7-Million-Dollar-List".

 Your one-time stake is US $160.
#1. Send $30 to the person in position 7   (your sponsor)
#2. Send $10 to the person in position 4   (bonus position)
#3. Send $100 to the person in position 1  (prime position)
#4. Send $20 to "7MG" (program administration)

All payments must be sent money order by fed-ex letters. Make 
sure to send copies of money orders and tracking numbers
to "7MG" who is monitoring and controlling the system closely. 
As soon as  "7MG" receives your membership registration with
the list of names approved, you can immediately proceed to 
the next step. A copy of this circular with your letter protector
code and your name in position #7 on the GP"7-Million Dollar
-List" will be sent to you along with your 9 reports.

All you have to do is to find at least 5 new members. Each of 
them will send you $30 via fed-ex  and you already have earned 
money! Your participation starts at position 7 on the GP
"7-Million-Dollar-List". Assuming that everyone will also introduce 
5 new members you wil get $10 each from 625 people when you
reach position 4 on the GP"7-Million-Dollar-List". This totals $6,250
- but this program is designed to rake much more money right into
 your pocket. 

 By continously moving up the list you will reach position
one within only a few short weeks. Being now in the prime position 
on thousands and thousands of  GP"7-Million-Dollar-Lists" 
you will receive up to 78,125 fed-ex letters containing $100 each.

THIS IS THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF $7,812,500

You can keep this money, it's yours and there's nothing expected 
in return. *A series of reports will be e-mailed to all members 
by 7MG,  there's nothing for you to do but find 5 members and 
wait for your express letters with money orders. It should be 
very easy to convince other people of this opportunity. Make
sure to introduce as many new members as possible into this 
fantastic program.
