be called to 'World Currency Cartel' organization based in California. The

been divulged to the general public. While their purpose is not yet known,
their presence has most certainly been felt".

NBC Nightly News:   "Members of the World Currency Cartel organization,
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''        who always keep Low Profile of themselves, are some
of the most powerful and wealthiest people in this hemisphere".
