Hello,

I am the mailer of this invitation, and just one of the 
many people in the Easy Money, Compound Leveraging, 
Educational Program, who is determined to help YOU 
become financially independent!

 ..... Have you ever wished that you could find a money 
creating, mail order program that is simple enough, and 
cheap enough to promote, that all you need to do, 
is get in, tell a few friends about it and get Rich Quick, 
without leaving the comfort of your own home?

 Well, my friend, .................You have finally found it!

  I recently became involved in this plan, by responding 
to a flyer just like the one below this letter. I spent 
only $5 out of my pocket to get started, and began receiving 
envelopes  with money inside them, just a few days  
after entering the program.

 ... I could not believe my eyes, at first, because I 
had not even had time to tell anyone about the program, 
so I dug through the pile of other mail order junk on 
my desk, and I found the information on the Life Without 
Debt Plan, that I had received the previous week and I 
Re-read every word trying to find a catch, because I was 
sure there must be one! 
Guess What,!!! The catch is there is no catch!

 ... I also called the person who mailed me the plan, 
to ask how this happened so fast! He explained the plan, 
as best he could, but said he did not know much, except 
that he to was receiving money in the mail almost daily, 
yet he had only started advertising, by mailing a few 
flyers each week.

 ..... He told me to advance to the next steps as 
instructed in the information kit, because that was 
what he had done, and my envelopes of money would have 
larger sums in them, from that point on!

.. I advanced to the additional plans, and behold, 
believe it or not, the envelopes of money come to my 
mail box daily, and they get fatter and fatter, every 
single day, with more money in each envelope!

 .. I know the plan can work for YOU too! Give it a try! 
You have nothing to loose and everything to gain!

 ...Return your completed Form Below, and $5 cash, to the 
computer center as soon as possible, so the data entry folks 
can place some of the folks responding to my mailings 
under you!

..They only accept cash because they turn it around immediately and send it out to the people already in the program.  They don't have time to deal with cashing checks and tracking down bad ones which is time consuming and costly.


 ......... If you need to contact me to ask questions, 
Email me at 

iglooy@postmaster.co.uk 

... I will be happy to answer any question you have, 
About this fantastic opportunity, If I can, although 
I'm new to the program, and to tell you the truth, 
I don't care how it works, because I know it works, 
Even if I don't understand everything! Lord Knows, 
What would happen, if I knew how it works!!

Sincerely,

John Ball
