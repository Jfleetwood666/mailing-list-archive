Damn. Talk about a blow to the heart.

Where can I find more information about this great man and his
achievements? Has there been any memorial web sites put up? I'de be happy
to donate space on my server. Just e-mail me at god@max-web.com. Are there
any news stories worth reading on this subject?

&gt;Subject: IP: Remembrance/postel
&gt;From: Dave Farber [farber@cis.upenn.edu]
&gt;
&gt;I, and others I fear, have spent a sleepless night after hearing of the
&gt;death of Jon Postel last night. This morning there was a  note in my
&gt;mail box from Vint Cerf that said many of the things I feel at this
&gt;time. I asked him for permission to send on which he granted.
&gt;
&gt;I also remember Jon. I was his primary thesis advisor along with Jerry
&gt;Estrin and I remember with fond memories the months spent closely
&gt;working with Jon while his eager mind developed the ideas in back of
&gt;what was a pioneering thesis that founded the area of protocol
&gt;verification.  Since I was at UC Irvine and Jon at UCLA we used to meet
&gt;in the morning prior to my ride to UCI at a Pancake House in Santa
&gt;Monica for breakfast and the hard work of developing a thesis. I gained
&gt;a great respect for Jon then and 10 pounds of weight.
&gt;
&gt;I will miss him greatly. Jon was my second Ph.D. student. The first,
&gt;Philip Merlin, also died way before his time.

&gt;
&gt;I REMEMBER IANA
&gt;
&gt;Vint Cerf
&gt;
&gt;A long time ago, in a network, far far away, a great adventure took
&gt;place...
&gt;
&gt;Out of the chaos of new ideas for communication, the experiments, the
&gt;tentative designs, and crucible of testing, there emerged a cornucopia
&gt;of networks. Beginning with the ARPANET, an endless stream of networks
&gt;evolved, and ultimately were interlinked to become the Internet. Someone
&gt;had to keep track of all the protocols, the identifiers, networks and
&gt;addresses and ultimately the names of all the things in the networked
&gt;universe. And someone had to keep track of all the information that
&gt;erupted with volcanic force from the intensity of the debates and
&gt;discussions and endless invention that has continued unabated for 30
&gt;years. That someone was Jonathan B. Postel, our Internet Assigned
&gt;Numbers Authority, friend, engineer, confidant, leader, icon, and now,
&gt;first of the giants to depart from our midst.
&gt;
&gt;Jon, our beloved IANA, is gone. Even as I write these words I cannot
&gt;quite grasp this stark fact. We had almost lost him once before in 1991.
&gt;Surely we knew he was at risk as are we all. But he had been our rock,
&gt;the foundation on which our every web search and email was built, always
&gt;there to mediate the random dispute, to remind us when our documentation
&gt;did not do justice to its subject, to make difficult decisions with
&gt;apparent ease, and to consult when careful consideration was needed. We
&gt;will survive our loss and we will remember. He has left a monumental
&gt;legacy for all Internauts to contemplate. Steadfast service for decades,
&gt;moving when others seemed paralyzed, always finding the right course in
&gt;a complex minefield of technical and sometimes political obstacles.
&gt;
&gt;Jon and I went to the same high school, Van Nuys High, in the San
&gt;Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles. But we were in different classes
&gt;and I really didn't know him then. Our real meeting came at UCLA when we
&gt;became a part of a group of graduate students working for Prof. Leonard
&gt;Kleinrock on the ARPANET project. Steve Crocker was another of the Van
&gt;Nuys crowd who was part of the team and led the development of the first
&gt;host-host protocols for the ARPANET. When Steve invented the idea of the
&gt;Request for Comments series, Jon became the instant editor. When we
&gt;needed to keep track of all the hosts and protocol identifiers, Jon
&gt;volunteered to be the Numbers Czar and later the IANA once the Internet
&gt;was in place. 
&gt;
&gt;Jon was a founding member of the Internet Architecture Board and served
&gt;continuously from its founding to the present. He was the FIRST
&gt;individual member of the Internet Society I know, because he and Steve
&gt;Wolff raced to see who could fill out the application forms and make
&gt;payment first and Jon won. He served as a trustee of the Internet
&gt;Society. He was the custodian of the .US domain, a founder of the Los
&gt;Nettos Internet service, and, by the way, managed the networking
&gt;research division of USC Information Sciences Institute.
&gt;
&gt;Jon loved the outdoors. I know he used to enjoy backpacking in the high
&gt;Sierras around Yosemite. Bearded and sandaled, Jon was our resident
&gt;hippie-patriarch at UCLA. He was a private person but fully capable of
&gt;engaging photon torpedoes and going to battle stations in a good
&gt;engineering argument. And he could be stubborn beyond all expectation.
&gt;He could have outwaited the Sphinx in a staring contest, I think.
&gt;
&gt;Jon inspired loyalty and steadfast devotion among his friends and his
&gt;colleagues. For me, he personified the words "selfless service." For
&gt;nearly 30 years, Jon has served us all, taken little in return, indeed
&gt;sometimes receiving abuse when he should have received our deepest
&gt;appreciation. It was particularly gratifying at the last Internet
&gt;Society meeting in Geneva to see Jon receive the Silver Medal of the
&gt;International Telecommunications Union. It is an award generally
&gt;reserved for Heads of State but I can think of no one more deserving of
&gt;global recognition for his contributions. 
&gt;
&gt;While it seems almost impossible to avoid feeling an enormous sense of
&gt;loss, as if a yawning gap in our networked universe had opened up and
&gt;swallowed our friend, I must tell you that I am comforted as I
&gt;contemplate what Jon has wrought. He leaves a legacy of edited documents
&gt;that tell our collective Internet story, including not only the
&gt;technical but also the poetic and whimsical as well. He completed the
&gt;incorporation of a successor to his service as IANA and leaves a lasting
&gt;legacy of service to the community in that role. His memory is rich and
&gt;vibrant and will not fade from our collective consciousness. "What would
&gt;Jon have done?" we will think, as we wrestle in the days ahead with the
&gt;problems Jon kept so well tamed for so many years. 
&gt;
&gt;There will almost surely be many memorials to Jon's monumental service
&gt;to the Internet Community. As current chairman of the Internet Society,
&gt;I pledge to establish an award in Jon's name to recognize long-standing
&gt;service to the community, the Jonathan B. Postel Service Award, which is
&gt;awarded to Jon posthumously as its first recipient.
&gt;
&gt;If Jon were here, I am sure he would urge us not to mourn his passing
&gt;but to celebrate his life and his contributions. He would remind us that
&gt;there is still much work to be done and that we now have the
&gt;responsibility and the opportunity to do our part. I doubt that anyone
&gt;could possibly duplicate his record, but it stands as a measure of one
&gt;man's astonishing contribution to a community he knew and loved.

Does God know Peano Algebra? Or does she not care if strong atheists
couldnt reason their way out of a trap made of Boolean presumptions?

A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing, but zero knowlege is
absolutely subversive.

Overspecialization breeds in weakness. It's a slow death.

Beat your algorithms into swords, your dumb terminals into shields, and
turn virtual machines into battlefields... Let the weak say, "I am strong"
and question authority.
