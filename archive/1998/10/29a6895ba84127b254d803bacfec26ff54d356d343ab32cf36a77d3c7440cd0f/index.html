Mail Your Message to MILLIONS!  through 
the POWER &amp; MAGIC OF E-MAIL!!!
ARE YOU Tired of NOT making money on the Internet?
Did you REALLY believe that ALL you had to do was put up a web page with some attractive graphics, some Java, some frames, run a few classified ads, post to a few newsgroups, swap a few banner ads, and it allstarts to roll in? Well, that's NOT the way it is!
It's all about traffic, and getting your INTERESTING MESSAGE in front of
INTERESTED PEOPLE, lots of 'em!!!!!! If you want to make money on the Internet, you should do all the rest, AND MAKE IT A POINT TO DO THIS ONE!!!
You've got to be savvy, aggressive, and get your message in front of LOTS OF PEOPLE!
And IF YOU HAVE TO DO THAT, WHY NOT USE ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE and instant MEANS OF TELLING YOUR STORY TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, EVEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE? IT SURE MAKES SENSE, DOESN'T IT?
 		Use Bulk email - IT WORKS, !!! 
............a well-written, strategically targeted E-MAIL MESSAGE, fulfilling an identified need, can and will make you money on the Internet, even on a limited budget,  as long as you GET IT IN FRONT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE. 
				WHY IS IT SO EFFECTIVE?
	a) Because it is the MOST COST EFFECTIVE MEDIUM EVER                          CREATED!
	On the average, an individual direct (snail) mail promotion would cost around 	$500.00 per thousand , whereas bulk e-mail costs pennies per thousand. No                                    known 	form of media advertising can compete with the low cost of bulk 
           e-mail.
            b) Because it is INSTANT, no waiting for the snail mail to eventually get to its 	destination. You get a reading almost immediately on the impact of your              message.
	c) Because you can hit your target right right in the BULLS EYE!
	d) Because PEOPLE READ E-MAIL! Your message will sit in your                recipient' mail box until is it read.  It's SEEN, not BURIED!
