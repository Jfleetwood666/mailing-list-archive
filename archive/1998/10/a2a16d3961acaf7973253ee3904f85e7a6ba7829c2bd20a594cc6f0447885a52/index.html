  Increase Your Website Traffic Within 72 Hours!

    We'll put YOUR website at the top of the search engines!
 

If your site isn't getting the traffic it should, chances are it's because it's not ranked well on the major Internet search engines. According to recent studies on Internet commerce, over 90% of consumers find the websites they visit by using "The Big Eight" search engines. If your website isn't located in the top 20 pages of those engines, chances are your site will never be seen. What's the point of having an "invisible" website?

The SINGLE most important thing you can do increase your website traffic is to increase your search engine rank.

That's what we'll do for you.


HUGE RESULTS... LITTLE EFFORT...

You can spend hours marketing your site using every technique around, but 
they will all pale in comparison to getting your site properly ranked.  By 
getting to the top of the search engines, you can have HUGE amounts of 
visitors at your site in as little as 72 HOURS!



HOW THE SEARCH ENGINES RANK YOUR SITE...

When you submit your website to a search engine to be indexed in its 
database, it sends a "robot" out to scan your page. Then, using complex 
algorithms to rank your page for keyword relevance, the "robot" determines 
whether you'll be ranked # 1 or 1,000,000 when potential visitors conduct a 
search looking for sites like yours.

Because the search engines are constantly changing their algorithms to help 
provide users the best possible search results, there's only one true 
solution to high search engine placement. 

Us.



WIN THE SEARCH ENGINE WARS!

We understand these algorithms and will use them very ethically and legitimately to get your website on top. Now you can experience the on-line success you originally built your website for.

If you're not happy with your website's performance, let The Search Engine 
Success Group put YOU on top.



               IT WILL BE THE BEST THING YOU EVER DO TO IMPROVE
 YOUR ON-LINE SUCCESS.




HERE'S WHAT WE DO...

In order to counter the ever changing search engine algorithms, we create 
an entire series of "entry pages" that is optimized for the search engines - one for EVERY keyword you give us! Each entry page is optimized to do well for a different set of algorithm variables. So instead of having ONE page struggling to rank well, we simply create separate entry pages for each keyword! It's through this unique approach that we're able to help YOU conquer the search engines.

Now understand, we don't use "tricks" to fool the engines.  That's unethical and something we won't do.  After all - it's your reputation we have to protect.  What we will do is simply present very relevant keywords for your site to the search engines in the way that they like to see it.  Consequently, your pages rank well because they DO contain information HIGHLY relevant to the search query.  We NEVER build pages for irrelevant yet "popular" keywords.

The "entry pages" act as a welcome screen for your website.  They will say a
few introductory things about your site and then ask the visitor to "Click 
Here To Enter," taking them directly to your current homepage.

In creating these entry pages we DO NOT make any changes to the existing
structure, content, or functionality of your current site. All pages we
construct will link directly into your existing site. As a result, you
can rest assured that your current website will remain exactly the same.




HOW WELL DOES THE SERVICE WORK?

We'll send you a detailed report of your current search engine ranking on 
The Big Eight engines before we begin. Then, once your new entry pages have 
been indexed, we'll send you a second report showing how they've done. 
You'll be able to confirm the results yourself.


Here's a sampling of some results we've gotten for previous clients.  These
examples are for COMPETITIVE keywords - not obscure words that nobody's 
looking for...


&lt;&gt; 6 top 10 rankings on Infoseek for DIFFERENT relevant keywords

&lt;&gt; 18 top 10 rankings across the major search engines

&lt;&gt; 3 top 10 rankings on Alta Vista for ONE keyword

&lt;&gt; 16 total #1 rankings (and an astounding 40 top 30 rankings across 
   the different engines!!)

&lt;&gt; 1-2 hits per week exploded to 500 per day

&lt;&gt; 45,000 hits per month grew to 108,000... (and it's still growing!)



CLIENT COMMENTS:

"INCREDIBLE!! Our site is now receiving more hits in a day than we used to 
get in an entire month. [My boss] is still eating his words!"
-Bob W.

"I knew the search engines were an incredible marketing tool, but my company
simply didn't have the time to devote to search engine placement. It has 
proven to be the best money we've ever spent on marketing. We'll be sending 
you some referrals for sure! 
Thanks."
-Shelley H.

"I worked for weeks to get good search engine placement, but I could never 
crack the top 80...my site was deserted. Within a month [after using your 
service], I'd had more hits than I'd had in the last year. I wouldn't believe
it if it hadn't happened to me. Please don't mention a word to the 
competition."
-Chris L.

***  Remember - our job is to increase your website's rank.  That's what we do.  We can't guarantee, however, that this will increase the number of visitors you get.  Some highly-ranked websites still don't get much traffic.  Much depends on your particular industry and choice of keywords.
