When I was a prof at Washington State University 1966-79 we traveled to

I always wondered why I saw so many sick kids in Spokane.

Heath Effects of Nuke Sites Targeted

DOE's Richardson
to Review Reports

The Associated Press

DENVER - U.S. Energy Secr-
ary Bill Richardson says he will
investigate reports of health prob-
lems among people living near or
working at federal nuclear weapons.

states.

  A total of 410 people told a news-
per, The Tennessean, they are
suffering from unexplained illness-
including tremors, memory toss,
fatigue and a variety of breathing,
muscular and reproductive prob-
lems. Their doctors cannot explain
why they are sick.

  No direct link has been estab-
lished between the illnesses and the

  Department of Energy sites. But
doctors, scientists and lawmakers
say it's large enough to warrant a
comprehensive study to try to find
the cause.

"My views we ought to get to the
bottom of this," Richardson told the
newspaper after meeting Friday
with residents near the Rocky Flats 
nuclear site in Denver. "I want to be
absolutely sure we're erring on the
side of making sure there are no
problems."

  Scientists have been concerned
for decades about radiation from
nuclear production and its link to
cancer But no one has ever looked
into noncancerous illnesses.

  During a 22-month investigation,
the newspaper found ill people at 13
DOE sites in Tennessee, Colorado,
South Carolina, New Mexico, Idaho,
New York, California, Ohio, Ken-
tucky, Texas and Washington.

  The Energy Department had ear-
lier said it does not plan to take a
comprehensive look at the issue.

Here is some other relevant information about the U.S. goverment,
Department of Energy, and nukes from Wierd History 101  by  
John Richard Stephens
http://www.thegrid.net/fern.canyon/weird/contents.htm

[A]nd then there are the legitimate concerns of
terrorists using nuclear weapons. This risk is
emphasized by the many incidents where the
smugglers of nuclear components have been
caught. But let's not get into that.
  Ever since the bombs were dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, people have worried
about having one of these horrors dropped on
them. Since the demise of the Soviet Union, this
threat has become more nebulous, making it a bit
more difficult for people to focus their fears.16 As
a result, their fears have diminished somewhat
even though the threat has probably increased
because of the increase in countries that have the

Roughly half of these could be launched with a few
minutes notice.

bomb and the advances in technology that enable
a bomb to be made from fissionable material the
size of a beer can, while a bomb that can level a
city can now be made to fit into a knapsack. But
during the Cold War, the threat seemed much
more immediate.
  Partly in response to these fears, the govern-
ment implemented programs to teach people how
they could protect themselves in the event of a
nuclear attack. Early efforts downplayed the risks.
One amazing example of this is the pamphlet
Survival Under Atomic Attack. Published by the
U.S. government in 1950, this official booklet
proclaims, "You can SURVIVE. You can live
through an atom bomb raid and you won't have to
have a Geiger counter, protective clothing, or spe-
cial training in order to do it." And then it goes on
to give such advice as, 'After an air burst, wait a
few minutes then go help to fight fires. After
other kinds of bursts wait at least 1 hour to give
lingering radiation some chance to die down."

Discussing the role of the IRS in a nuclear attack,
the Internal Revenue Service Handbook (1976)
says, 

  "During a state of national emergency
  resulting from enemy attack, the essential
  functions of the Service will be as follows: (1)
  assessing, collecting, and recording taxes. . ."

  Where is the Best Place to Go?
  If you live in a State where there is danger
from sudden storms like cyclones or hurricanes,
you may have a "cyclone cellar" or something
similar. If so, you have a shelter that will give
excellent protection against atomic bombs.
  [People soon realized this wasn't quite true,
and they began building bomb shelters.]

  "All you have to do to protect yourself from
  radiation is go down to the bottom of your
  swimming pool and hold your breath."

    -David Miller Department of Energy
      spokesperson

 [S]o there you have it. You're now prepared to
survive nuclear warfare. Think you can handle it?
  Actually, it's very hard to believe that, after five
years of intensively studying the effects of atomic
bombs and radiation at Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and
various tests involving military personnel as
human guinea pigs, the government didn't have a
better idea of the dangers.

  "My fellow Americans. I am pleased to tell you I
  just signed legislation which outlaws Russia
  forever. The bombing begins in five minutes."

  -President Ronald Reagan during a sound
  check for a live radio show, 1984

  [I]n one of the tests in 1953, U.S. soldiers were
placed near the explosion to test how well they
could function after a blast. Sergeant Reason
Warehime was one of fifty soldiers who were in a
trench two miles from ground zero. They wore no
protective gear. "The first thing I saw" he later
reported, "was a real bright light like a flashbulb
going off in my face, but it stayed on. It was so
bright that even with sunglasses on, my hands
over my eyes, and my eyes closed, I could actually
see the bones in my hands. I felt as if someone was
hugging me really tight, and my whole body was
being compressed. All of a sudden, I heard an
awful noise and felt an intensely hot wind blowing
and the ground rocking like an earthquake. The
dust was so thick I could not see the man right
next to me. The air was so hot that it was difficult
to breathe. . . . Since the fireball was directly over
our heads, there is no doubt in my mind that we
were in the 'stem' of the mushroom cloud."
  A voice over a loudspeaker ordered them to
advance toward ground zero. The sandbags along
the top of their trench were on fire. On reaching
a bunker that was just over a mile from ground
zero, they found eight men. "Those guys were
sick as dogs and heaving their guts out," he said.
Soon they began finding spots where the sand had
melted into glass. After reaching the crater, they
turned back and eventually were picked up by
two radiation specialists in full protective gear.
On the way back, Warehime and some of his
companions started throwing up. A few months
later; all of his hair fell out, his teeth began to rot,
and he was diagnosed as sterile. Eventually, he
developed cataracts, lung cancer; his bones
became brittle, and he had to use crutches to get
around. Even though radiation is known to cause
these things, in the  1980s, the Veterans
Administration insisted his problems weren't
caused by this bomb and denied disability to him
and many others like him. An estimated 250,000
military personnel were exposed to radiation in
experiments between 1946 and the 1970s. Many
additional civilians were also used as guinea pigs
in radiation tests. Very few have ever received any
compensation for or assistance with the perma-
nent damage caused to them.
  Warehime was exposed to a forty-three-
kiloton (not megaton) bomb. It turned out to be
almost twice as powerful as the physicists had
calculated it would be and was about twice as
powerful as those used on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. Its radiation cloud spread across the
nation from Nevada, fogging undeveloped film
as far away as New Jersey.

Morales and I are in the planning stage to put up a web site.

John Young has been encouraging us to do this.

Reason is that we are going after the judges and clerks in the
Tenth circuit who awarded our court wins to Sandia we, in fact,
we won.  Now that John Young got the docket for us.

Also I will be doing a Privacy Act violation defamation lawsuit against
Sandia, DOE, EEOC, Lockheed Martin, AT&amp;T, and named defendants.

We will have several FORUMS.

1 Pro se litigation against the U.S. Federal government
2 Microsoft Assembler mixed-language programming
3 80C32 hardware, Forth high-level and assembler programming.

at least.

John Young started 3. http://jya.com/f86/whpf86.htm

1 and 2 may be compatible.  

Microsoft distributes buggy software while Gates, Paul Allen, and Balmer 
become some of the richest men in the world.

Perhaps, with some legal encouragement, the above three should spend
some of 
their money getting the bugs out of their software.

To kick-off 1 and 2 I am thinking of posting a complaint against
Microsoft for 
having scammed me by not included a 32 bit linker with MASM 6.11 I just
bought.
If we don't settle, of course.  I will check e-mail in a few minutes to
see
how progress to get the 32 bit linker is coming.

Microsoft appears to want me to buy a C compiler or Windows NT  SDK
[software
development kit] to get the 32 bit linker.

With all this scary stuff of effects of nukes, let's hope Rep. McKinney
and Senator
Grassley are making progress to help get NSA to post the requested
documents.
http://jya.com/whpfiles.htm

And, too, let's ALL hope for settlement so that we can move on to other
constructive
projects.  Before things GET WORSE.

Especially,

  While a one-time pad is, in fact, theoretically unbreakable when
used   properly, the details of using it properly make it entirely
unusable    in any modern commercial or military setting. 

And 

  This kind of system was used for the U.S.-Soviet teletype "hot line"  
and it is occasionally used for paper ciphers and spies, but that's   
it.

Codes and Cryptography by Dominic Welsh references on page 126 Sandia's
Gus Simmons as the source of the above.

  (And if users can exchange these keys, why can't they just
exchange     the messages?)

I think the reason is that the users want to exchange keys for messages
to be sent at a later time, perhaps electronically.

But we have to stick to the position.

Does the algorithm pass the Black and White test or not?  No buts.

Let's all hope for settlement of this UNFORTUNATE matter before it

Counterfeiting Wiegand Wire Access Credentials

                  Wiegand wire access credentials are easy and
                  inexpensive to counterfeit.
     
        Access Control &amp; Security Systems Integration magazine, October
        1996 [http://www/securitysolutions.com] published the article,
     
             Wiegand technology stands the test of time
     
             by PAUL J. BODELL, page 12
     
             Many card and reader manufacturers offer Wiegand (pronounced
             wee-gand) output.  However, only three companies in the
             world make Wiegand readers.  Sensor Engineering of Hamden
             Conn., holds the patent for Wiegand, and Sensor has licensed
             Cardkey of Simi Valley, Calif., and Doduco of Pforzheim,
             Germany, to manufacture Wiegand cards and readers. ...  A
             Wiegand output reader is not the same thing as a Wiegand
             reader,  and it is important to understand the differences.
     
                In brief, Wiegand reader use the Wiegand effect to
             translate card information around the patented Wiegand
             effect in which a segment of a specially treated wire
             generates an electronic pulse when subjected to a specific
             magnetic field.  If the pulse is generated when the wire is
             near a pick-up coil, the pulse can be detected by a circuit.
             Lining up several rows of wires and passing them by a cold
             would generate a series of pulses.  Lining up two rows of
             wires - calling on row "zero bits" and the other "one bits"
             - and passing them by two different coils would generate two
             series of pulses, or data bits.  These data bits can then be
             interpreted as binary data and used to control other
             devices.  If you seal the coils in a rugged housing with
             properly placed magnets, and LED and some simple circuitry,
             you have a Wiegand reader.  Carefully laminate the special
             wires in vinyl, and artwork, and hot-stamp a number on the
             vinyl, and you have a Wiegand card.
     
             IN THE BEGINNING
     
               Wiegand was first to introduce to the access control
             market in the late 1970s.  It was immediately successful
             because it filled the need for durable, secure card and
             reader technology.
               Embedded in the cards, Wiegand wires cannot be altered or
             duplicated. ...
     
        Bodell's Last statement is incorrect.
     
        Tasks for EASILY counterfeiting Wiegand wire cards are
     
        1    Locate the wires inside the card to read the 0s and 1s.
     
        2    Build an ACCEPTABLE copy of the card.
     
        Bodell's clear explanation of the working of a Wiegand card can
        be visualized
     
             zero row    |     |   |
     
             one row        |          |
     
             binary      0  1  0   0   1
             representation
     
        Solutions to Task 1
     
             A    X-ray the card
     
             B    MAGNI VIEW FILM,  Mylar film reads magnetic fields ...

                  205, C33,447  $11.75
     
        is placed over the top of the Wiegand card.
     
        COW MAGNET,  Cow magnetics allow farmers to trap metal in the
        stomachs of their cows.  Edmunds, page 204, C31,101 $10.75
        is placed under the card.
     
        Location of the wires is easily seen on the green film.
     
        Mark the position of the wires with a pen.
     
        Next chop the card vertically using a shear into about 80/1000s
        paper-match-sized strips.
     
        Don't worry about cutting a wire or two.
     
        Note that a 0 has the pen mark to the top.  A 1 has the pen mark
        at the bottom.
     
        Take a business card and layout the "paper match"-like strips to
        counterfeit the card number desired.
     
        Don't worry about spacing.  Wiegand output is self-clocking!
     
        Tape the "paper-match - like" strips to the business card.
     
        Only the FUNCTION of the card needs to be reproduced!
