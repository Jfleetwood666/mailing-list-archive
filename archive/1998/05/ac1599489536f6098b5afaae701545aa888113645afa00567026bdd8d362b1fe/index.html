Dear Friend:
 
 If you have already responded to the following announcement a few 
 days ago, that means your package is already on its way and it 
 should be arriving soon! If you have not responded to this before, 
 please pay attention to it now. This is very important!!!
 
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
 IMPORTANT ACCOUNCEMENT
 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 Your future May Depend on it !
 
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 Before you know about this 'Important Announcement', you must 
 first read the following 'Editorial Excerpts' from some important 
 publications in the United States:
 
 NEW YORK TIMES: "In concluding our review of Financial 
 organizations to effect change in the 90's, special attention 
 should be called to a California based organization, 'WORLD 
 CURRENCY CARTEL'. Members of this organization are amassing 
 hundred of millions of dollars in the currency market using a very 
 LEGAL method which has NEVER been divulged to the general public. 
 While their purpose is not yet known, their presence has most 
 certainly been felt".
 
 NBC NIGHTLY NEWS: "Members of 'World Currency Cartel', who always 
 keep a low profile, are considered to be some of the most 
 wealthiest people in North America".
 
 More excerpts later, but first let us give you this very 
 'IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT":
 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
 '''''''''
 We are glad to announce that for the first time and for a very 
 short period of time, WORLD CURRENCY CARTEL will instruct a 
 LIMITED number of people worldwide on 'HOW TO CONVERT $25 INTO ONE 
 HUNDRED OF LEGAL CURRENCY'. We will transact the first conversion 
 for you, after that you can easily and quickly do this on your own 
 hundreds or even thousands of times every month.
 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS "SECRET FLAW" !
 ******************************************************************
 ******************************************************************
 ***
 
 It is even more explosive than we have yet disclosed. While 
 currency does fluctuate daily, we can show you 'HOW TO CONVERT $99 
 INTO $588 AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT'. That means, you will be able 
 to EXCHANGE $99, AMERICAN LEGAL CURRENCY DOLLARS, FOR $580 OF THE 
 SAME. You can do this as many times as you wish, every day, every 
 week, every month. All very LEGAL and effortlessly!
 
 It takes only 5 to 10 minutes each time you do this. You can do 
 this from home, office or even while traveling. All you need is 
 an access to a phone line and an address. Best of all, you can do 
 this from ANY CITY ON THIS EARTH!!!
 
 Again, we must reiterate, anyone can do this and the source is 
 NEVER-ENDING. For as long as the global financial community 
 continues to use different currencies with varying exchange rates, 
 the "SECRET FLAW" will exist.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
 As we said earlier , we will do the first transaction for you and 
 will show you exactly how to do this on your own, over and over 
 again!
 
 The amount of exchange you would do each time is entirely up to 
 you. Working just 2 to 10 hours a week, you can soon join the list 
 of Millionaires who do this on a daily basis many times a day. The 
 transaction is so simple that even a high school kid can do it!
 
 We at the World Currency Cartel would like to see a uniform global 
 currency backed by Gold. But, until then, we will allow a LIMITED 
 number of individuals worldwide to share in the UNLIMITED PROFITS 
 provided for by the world currency differentials.
 
 We will espouse no more political views nor will we ask you to do 
 so. We can say however, that our parent organization, NDML, 
 benefits greatly by the knowledge being shared, as we 
 ourselves, along with YOU, benefit likewise. Your main concern 
 surely will be, how you will benefit.
 
 As soon as you become a member, you will make transactions from 
 your home, office, by telephone or through the mail. You can 
 conduct these transactions even while traveling.
 
 Don't believe us? Experience it for yourself!
 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
 Unlike anyone else, we will assure you great financial freedom and 
 you will add to our quickly growing base of supporters and join 
 the list of MILLIONAIRES being created using this very "SECRET 
 FLAW" in the world currency market.

 Here are some more 'Editorial Excerpts':

 WALL STREET: "A discreet group of Americans, operating under the 
 guise of World Currency Cartel have recently begun making rumbles in 
 world finance market. While at this time, their game is not completely 
 known, they certainly will be watched by those making major moves in the 
 currency contracts".
 
 FINANCIAL WEEK: "Watch them, monitor them, extract their knowledge 
 and try to become one of them. That is the soundest financial 
 advice we could give to anyone".
 
 NATIONAL BUSINESS WEEKLY: "While this reporter has been left in 
 the cold as to its method of operation, we have been able to 
 confirm that 'World Currency Cartel' and its members are literally 
 amassing great fortunes overnight".
