&gt;NSA police suspected in agency thefts
&gt;
&gt;50,000 rounds of ammunition reported stolen; 'An active investigation'; 2
&gt;officers allowed to resign; at least 9 others targeted
&gt;
&gt;By Tom Bowman
&gt;Sun National Staff
&gt;
&gt;WASHINGTON -- Nearly a dozen members of the police force that guards the
&gt;top-secret National Security Agency are suspected of stealing ammunition
&gt;from the Fort Meade-based agency, sources and federal officials said
&gt;yesterday.
&gt;
&gt;The thefts, which included up to 50,000 rounds of ammunition, represent an
&gt;embarrassing incident for the NSA, an intelligence agency that eavesdrops
&gt;on foreign communications and makes and breaks codes. Besides NSA
&gt;officials, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are
&gt;investigating the thefts.
&gt;
&gt;While no arrests have been made, several police officers have been
&gt;implicated, officials said. But details about the thefts and the progress
&gt;of the investigation remained sketchy yesterday.
&gt;
&gt;Larry Stewart, special agent in charge of the bureau's Baltimore office,
&gt;declined to comment on the amount of ammunition stolen or the number of
&gt;officers from the NSA's Security Protective Officer force who are under
&gt;investigation.
&gt;
&gt;"That I can't share with you," Stewart said. "The only thing I can tell you
&gt;is it's an active investigation, and we can't comment on that."
&gt;
&gt;NSA officials also declined to discuss the investigation. The agency
&gt;released a brief statement yesterday saying it was "nearing completion on
&gt;an investigation involving Security Protective Officers."
&gt;
&gt;Agency sources said two sergeants on the force have been allowed to resign
&gt;as a result of the investigation, including one who oversaw the force's
&gt;ammunition and weapons. At least nine other officers are under
&gt;investigation.
&gt;
&gt;The sergeant who was in charge of ammunition, William R. Fabus, said he had
&gt;resigned voluntarily on May 1 after he was questioned by agents.
&gt;
&gt;"I was not aware that anything was missing," said Fabus, 36, of
&gt;Catonsville, adding that he expects no further inquiries or criminal
&gt;charges. "I was told there was nothing criminal that I did."Fabus, a
&gt;10-year veteran of the force, declined to say why he had abruptly resigned.
&gt;"I don't know where I'm stepping," he said. "If I give out any information
&gt;considered national security stuff, it would be adverse toward me."
&gt;
&gt;Officer named others
&gt;
&gt;Officials would not say when they believe the thefts began or how they were
&gt;detected, though one former agency employee said the thefts had been
&gt;occurring for at least two months. The source said one officer was caught
&gt;and began implicating others.
&gt;
&gt;The thefts have resulted in new security procedures at the agency, sources
&gt;said, and employees have been warned not to talk about the investigation.
&gt;The NSA, which employs about 23,000 people at Fort Meade, is the largest
&gt;employer in Maryland.
&gt;
&gt;As part of the inquiry, investigators found grenades and assault rifles,
&gt;although neither were NSA property, sources said.
&gt;
&gt;"It shocked a lot of people," the former employee, who requested anonymity,
&gt;said of the thefts. "[The officers] are not kids; they've been working
&gt;there a long time."
&gt;
&gt;The uniformed police force includes several hundred officers and provides
&gt;security at NSA's sprawling complex off the Baltimore-Washington Parkway
&gt;and its satellite locations throughout Maryland.
&gt;
&gt;Top-security clearance
&gt;
&gt;The officers, whose average salary is about $30,000, undergo two months of
&gt;training at a facility in Georgia with other federal police officers, and
&gt;carry either 9 mm or 38-caliber handguns, former members of the force said.
&gt;
&gt;They also possess the government's top-security clearance, known as SCI for
&gt;Sensitive Compartmented Information, the eavesdropping product that is
&gt;among the nation's most guarded secrets.
&gt;
&gt;Officials would not say whether they suspect that the officers were using
&gt;the ammunition for their own use or were selling it. FBI spokesmen and
&gt;staffers on the congressional intelligence oversight committees said they
&gt;were unaware of the investigation.
&gt;
&gt;"This is the first I've heard of it," Larry Foust, an FBI spokesman in
&gt;Baltimore, said when called by a reporter. One top FBI official in
&gt;Washington privately expressed surprise that the bureau had not been
&gt;notified, considering the possible extent of the theft.
&gt;
&gt;Morale problems
&gt;
&gt;Besides the thefts, agency officials have pointed to administrative and
&gt;morale troubles among the force. In a recent report, portions of which were
&gt;obtained by The Sun, the agency noted tensions among the uniformed police
&gt;supervisors, many of whom are high school graduates, and a rising number of
&gt;college-educated officers who are being hired.
&gt;
&gt;"The supervisors may feel threatened by subordinates who may be brighter
&gt;and more willing to empower themselves to make independent decisions," the
&gt;report said.
&gt;
&gt;Moreover, the report said, newly hired officers have not been given a
&gt;"realistic job preview."
&gt;
&gt;"It was widely believed that applicants may have been misled to believe
&gt;that the job entailed more sophisticated and responsible police functions
&gt;than actually take place," according to the report. "Boredom and lower
&gt;levels of job satisfaction are believed to be widespread amongst the more
&gt;educated [officers]."
