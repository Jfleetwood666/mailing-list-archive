&gt;[forwarded from Larry Becraft]
&gt;THE BIOMETRIC NATIONAL ID CARD IS NOW A REALITY...
&gt;By Jon Christian Ryter
&gt;Author of WHATEVER HAPPENED TO AMERICA?
&gt;and THE BAFFLED CHRISTIAN'S HANDBOOK
&gt;
&gt;America was rightfully alarmed in late September when Representatives Bob
&gt;Barr (R-GA) and Ron Paul (TX) revealed the fact that somehow, unbeknown to
&gt;anyone, and for some as yet unexplained reason, the National ID Card that
&gt;Hillary Clinton, Marc Tucker and Ira Magaziner had adroitly concealed in the
&gt;failed Health Security Act of 1994 had somehow "accidentally" been passed,
&gt;in a somewhat illegal and unconstitutional fashion, and was now "the law of
&gt;the land."
&gt;
&gt;Pictured (see link below) is the actual "Healthcare Passport" card currently
&gt;being used in three American cities. Displayed is the front and back of that
&gt;card. This photo was scanned from the brochure used by the National
&gt;Institute of Health to introduce the new card in a seminar in Denver earlier
&gt;this year. The word "passport" on the card had to have been a
&gt;tongue-in-cheek addition, since it is the precursor of the internal passport
&gt;that will ultimately control your ability to move freely throughout this
&gt;great land. The card is biometric. Stored on this card is the complete
&gt;medical history of the card's owner. Also stored on the card is every
&gt;conceivable piece of information about that person. Imbedded in the card is
&gt;a tracking devise.
&gt;
&gt;The plan to create and implement a National ID Card, while first made
&gt;"public" in a private White House meeting on Nov. 11, 1993 and discussed in
&gt;a disavowed protocol that detailed the dialogue of that meeting, is not
&gt;uniquely a Clintonoid idea even though the National ID Card first appears
&gt;innocuously concealed in the Health Security Act as a "healthcare benefits
&gt;card" that the First Lady insisted had to be carried by every American--even
&gt;if they refused to be covered by the plan--under penalty of law.
&gt;
&gt;	The same card, in the form of a national driver's license, had just been
&gt;mandated by the European Union for all of the new European States. A brief
&gt;battle waged in Europe over the national driver's license. Most Europeans
&gt;had experienced national identity cards in the past and realized quickly the
&gt;new universal European driver's license was an internal passport that would
&gt;give their new government the tool they needed to control their lives. The
&gt;media immediately labeled those who resisted the EU driver's license as
&gt;"globalphobes" who were against progress, and wanted to return Europe to the
&gt;days of the cold war. They were the extremists.
&gt;
&gt;	In the United States, the Clinton's knew a National ID Card spelled
&gt;problems,
&gt;regardless what name was put on it. However, as a healthcare card that
&gt;provided each American with thousands of dollars of free medical care, they
&gt;correctly surmised that the ramblings of the right wing zealots could be
&gt;easily dismissed by the mainstream liberal media. The media did its job
&gt;well.
&gt;
&gt;The Health Security Act was the best thing since sliced bread and peanut
&gt;butter. According to the media, the Health Security Act would provide
&gt;healthcare for the millions upon millions of uninsured Americans. The media
&gt;even obliged by ignoring the obviously flawed cost assessments as well.
&gt;
&gt;Hillary demanded that Congress pass the Health Security Act without and
&gt;changes--reminiscent of FDR's passing the "emergency legislation" that
&gt;kicked off the New Deal without allowing members of Congress to even see the
&gt;legislation they were voting on--and unconstitutionally granting Roosevelt
&gt;almost dictatorial power over the United States. Congress wasn't buying.
&gt;They read the Health Security Act. Then, they rejected it. It was, they
&gt;declared, the most expensive social experiment in the world.
&gt;
&gt;Buried in the National Archives, in the working papers of the Hillary
&gt;Clinton healthcare plan, was a game plan in the event the Health Security
&gt;Act went down in flaming defeat. The game plan?  Implement another
&gt;healthcare act that provided healthcare for children.  No one would dare
&gt;deny healthcare to children. To introduce the plan, they called on Teddy
&gt;Kennedy. Kennedy failed. Kennedy, they realized, was trusted by most
&gt;Americans even less than the Clintons.
&gt;
&gt;Next they turned to Orrin Hatch, who teamed up with Kennedy and rammed the
&gt;legislation through Congress. Healthcare for kids. Of course, everyone was
&gt;in favor of it. Voting against it was a good way to lose an election. And,
&gt;once the law was codified, the bureaucracy possessed the authority to simply
&gt;expand it to include anyone and everyone.
&gt;
&gt;What was not in the legislation was funding to create a biometric health
&gt;care card. The authority to do it was there, but not the money. For the
&gt;money, the Clinton administration turned to the Robert Wood Johnson
&gt;Foundation. The foundation, created by the founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson,
&gt;obliged and funded the experimental program which was kicked off in three
&gt;western cities (noted above).
&gt;
&gt;What was introduced to members of the National Institute of Health in Denver
&gt;as a card that will record the inoculation records of children, includes
&gt;everything from DNA typing to that individual's medical, psychiatric and
&gt;financial history. It was because the biometric card would also contain the
&gt;psychiatric history of the cardholder that an employee of the National
&gt;Institute of Health approached me and offered me the data that is contained
&gt;in this report.
&gt;
&gt;In my initial meeting with the NIH employee, I was also told that this
&gt;person had commented to a NIH executive that it was not good for the card to
&gt;contain so much personal information that was not needed to monitor the
&gt;rates of inoculation of the children covered by the program, since it would
&gt;provide the government information that could easily be misused.
&gt;
&gt;At that point the NIH executive laughed and said: "What do you think we have
&gt;do with the data we get from Medicare and Medicaid? We've been using it for
&gt;years to apprehend and deport illegal aliens and to capture those wanted by
&gt;the law."
&gt;
&gt;In the case of the Health Passport, which is the precursor of the National
&gt;Driver's License that will go into affect nationwide on October 1, 2000,
&gt;however, the is one added feature--it contains a tracking chip.
&gt;
&gt;At a recent National Institute of Health seminar, an NIH executive proudly
&gt;displayed an electronic map created by the NIH computer technicians that
&gt;pinpointed every Health Passport card holder in Denver, Colorado. It was a
&gt;"living map" that would track each Health Passport card holder if and when
&gt;they moved. Whether or not such a map had been created for the other two
&gt;"pilot" cities is not known.
&gt;
&gt;NOTE: Before I left Washington this afternoon, I spoke for about a half hour
&gt;with Stan Johnson of the Prophecy Club, and emailed Stan a copy of the Heath
&gt;Passport Card. Stan has additional information on this subject, particularly
&gt;with respect to a new computer mainframe that the government recently
&gt;installed in Denver that ties in with the information I have been receiving
&gt;from my own source in the National Institute of Health. Apparently this is
&gt;the planned topic for the Prophecy Club's radio talk show next Monday (and
&gt;because it is, I will not reveal any of the revelations that Stan shared
&gt;with me on the phone this afternoon. I would strongly urge you to visit
&gt;Stan's website for additional information.

&gt;HEALTH PASSPORT
&gt;
&gt;A Project of the Western Governors' Association
&gt;- Frequently Asked Questions -
&gt;
&gt;Introduction to the Health Passport Project
&gt;
&gt;What is the Health Passport Project?
&gt;
&gt;The Health Passport Project is a three-city demonstration that uses what is
&gt;called a "smart card" to put important health-related information at the
&gt;fingertips of mothers and their children. People participating in the
&gt;demonstration are those eligible for care under public health programs. The
&gt;Health Passport Project is the largest health-care demonstration in the
&gt;United States for smart cards and will be conducted over two years in the
&gt;cities of Bismarck, North Dakota; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Reno, Nevada. The
&gt;project will demonstrate how people can use these electronic cards to give
&gt;up-to-date information to their health-care providers, including physicians,
&gt;nurses, nutritionists and early childhood educators.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Food Retailers
&gt;
&gt;Grocers who handle thousands of checks for nutrition benefits will find the
&gt;new system involves less paperwork, results in quicker check-out, and
&gt;provides more timely reimbursement. The Health Passport works like a bank
&gt;card at the check-out counter. Benefits are automatically downloaded to the
&gt;client's card at the retailer. Distribution of WIC benefits will be
&gt;demonstrated in Reno and Cheyenne.

&gt;
&gt;Health Passport
&gt;
&gt;Information Technology: Toward a Health Card for the West
&gt;
&gt;"Congress is considering the most sweeping changes to the delivery of social
&gt;services since the New Deal. In this environment, the Health Passport
&gt;presents an innovative tool to help ensure the continued delivery of
&gt;critical services to low income women and children--even as government
&gt;sponsored programs are consolidated or eliminated. While devolution of
&gt;authority to the states is expected to reduce duplicative federal
&gt;administrative structures, the debate in Washington has done little to
&gt;provide practical solutions. The Health Passport offers a tool to help
&gt;achieve these administrative savings empowering citizens and preserving the
&gt;integrity of services."
