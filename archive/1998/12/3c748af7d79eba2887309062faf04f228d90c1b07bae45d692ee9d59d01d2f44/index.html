[forwarded from Larry Becraft]
THE BIOMETRIC NATIONAL ID CARD IS NOW A REALITY...
By Jon Christian Ryter
Author of WHATEVER HAPPENED TO AMERICA?
and THE BAFFLED CHRISTIAN'S HANDBOOK

America was rightfully alarmed in late September when Representatives Bob
Barr (R-GA) and Ron Paul (TX) revealed the fact that somehow, unbeknown to
anyone, and for some as yet unexplained reason, the National ID Card that
Hillary Clinton, Marc Tucker and Ira Magaziner had adroitly concealed in the
failed Health Security Act of 1994 had somehow "accidentally" been passed,
in a somewhat illegal and unconstitutional fashion, and was now "the law of
the land."

Pictured (see link below) is the actual "Healthcare Passport" card currently
being used in three American cities. Displayed is the front and back of that
card. This photo was scanned from the brochure used by the National
Institute of Health to introduce the new card in a seminar in Denver earlier
this year. The word "passport" on the card had to have been a
tongue-in-cheek addition, since it is the precursor of the internal passport
that will ultimately control your ability to move freely throughout this
great land. The card is biometric. Stored on this card is the complete
medical history of the card's owner. Also stored on the card is every
conceivable piece of information about that person. Imbedded in the card is
a tracking devise.

The plan to create and implement a National ID Card, while first made
"public" in a private White House meeting on Nov. 11, 1993 and discussed in
a disavowed protocol that detailed the dialogue of that meeting, is not
uniquely a Clintonoid idea even though the National ID Card first appears
innocuously concealed in the Health Security Act as a "healthcare benefits
card" that the First Lady insisted had to be carried by every American--even
if they refused to be covered by the plan--under penalty of law.

	The same card, in the form of a national driver's license, had just been
mandated by the European Union for all of the new European States. A brief
battle waged in Europe over the national driver's license. Most Europeans
had experienced national identity cards in the past and realized quickly the
new universal European driver's license was an internal passport that would
give their new government the tool they needed to control their lives. The
media immediately labeled those who resisted the EU driver's license as
"globalphobes" who were against progress, and wanted to return Europe to the
days of the cold war. They were the extremists.

	In the United States, the Clinton's knew a National ID Card spelled
problems,
regardless what name was put on it. However, as a healthcare card that
provided each American with thousands of dollars of free medical care, they
correctly surmised that the ramblings of the right wing zealots could be
easily dismissed by the mainstream liberal media. The media did its job
well.

The Health Security Act was the best thing since sliced bread and peanut
butter. According to the media, the Health Security Act would provide
healthcare for the millions upon millions of uninsured Americans. The media
even obliged by ignoring the obviously flawed cost assessments as well.

Hillary demanded that Congress pass the Health Security Act without and
changes--reminiscent of FDR's passing the "emergency legislation" that
kicked off the New Deal without allowing members of Congress to even see the
legislation they were voting on--and unconstitutionally granting Roosevelt
almost dictatorial power over the United States. Congress wasn't buying.
They read the Health Security Act. Then, they rejected it. It was, they
declared, the most expensive social experiment in the world.

Buried in the National Archives, in the working papers of the Hillary
Clinton healthcare plan, was a game plan in the event the Health Security
Act went down in flaming defeat. The game plan?  Implement another
healthcare act that provided healthcare for children.  No one would dare
deny healthcare to children. To introduce the plan, they called on Teddy
Kennedy. Kennedy failed. Kennedy, they realized, was trusted by most
Americans even less than the Clintons.

Next they turned to Orrin Hatch, who teamed up with Kennedy and rammed the
legislation through Congress. Healthcare for kids. Of course, everyone was
in favor of it. Voting against it was a good way to lose an election. And,
once the law was codified, the bureaucracy possessed the authority to simply
expand it to include anyone and everyone.

What was not in the legislation was funding to create a biometric health
care card. The authority to do it was there, but not the money. For the
money, the Clinton administration turned to the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation. The foundation, created by the founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson,
obliged and funded the experimental program which was kicked off in three
western cities (noted above).

What was introduced to members of the National Institute of Health in Denver
as a card that will record the inoculation records of children, includes
everything from DNA typing to that individual's medical, psychiatric and
financial history. It was because the biometric card would also contain the
psychiatric history of the cardholder that an employee of the National
Institute of Health approached me and offered me the data that is contained
in this report.

In my initial meeting with the NIH employee, I was also told that this
person had commented to a NIH executive that it was not good for the card to
contain so much personal information that was not needed to monitor the
rates of inoculation of the children covered by the program, since it would
provide the government information that could easily be misused.

At that point the NIH executive laughed and said: "What do you think we have
do with the data we get from Medicare and Medicaid? We've been using it for
years to apprehend and deport illegal aliens and to capture those wanted by
the law."

In the case of the Health Passport, which is the precursor of the National
Driver's License that will go into affect nationwide on October 1, 2000,
however, the is one added feature--it contains a tracking chip.

At a recent National Institute of Health seminar, an NIH executive proudly
displayed an electronic map created by the NIH computer technicians that
pinpointed every Health Passport card holder in Denver, Colorado. It was a
"living map" that would track each Health Passport card holder if and when
they moved. Whether or not such a map had been created for the other two
"pilot" cities is not known.

NOTE: Before I left Washington this afternoon, I spoke for about a half hour
with Stan Johnson of the Prophecy Club, and emailed Stan a copy of the Heath
Passport Card. Stan has additional information on this subject, particularly
with respect to a new computer mainframe that the government recently
installed in Denver that ties in with the information I have been receiving
from my own source in the National Institute of Health. Apparently this is
the planned topic for the Prophecy Club's radio talk show next Monday (and
because it is, I will not reveal any of the revelations that Stan shared
with me on the phone this afternoon. I would strongly urge you to visit
Stan's website for additional information.

HEALTH PASSPORT

A Project of the Western Governors' Association
- Frequently Asked Questions -

Introduction to the Health Passport Project

What is the Health Passport Project?

The Health Passport Project is a three-city demonstration that uses what is
called a "smart card" to put important health-related information at the
fingertips of mothers and their children. People participating in the
demonstration are those eligible for care under public health programs. The
Health Passport Project is the largest health-care demonstration in the
United States for smart cards and will be conducted over two years in the
cities of Bismarck, North Dakota; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Reno, Nevada. The
project will demonstrate how people can use these electronic cards to give
up-to-date information to their health-care providers, including physicians,
nurses, nutritionists and early childhood educators.


Food Retailers

Grocers who handle thousands of checks for nutrition benefits will find the
new system involves less paperwork, results in quicker check-out, and
provides more timely reimbursement. The Health Passport works like a bank
card at the check-out counter. Benefits are automatically downloaded to the
client's card at the retailer. Distribution of WIC benefits will be
demonstrated in Reno and Cheyenne.

Health Passport

Information Technology: Toward a Health Card for the West

"Congress is considering the most sweeping changes to the delivery of social
services since the New Deal. In this environment, the Health Passport
presents an innovative tool to help ensure the continued delivery of
critical services to low income women and children--even as government
sponsored programs are consolidated or eliminated. While devolution of
authority to the states is expected to reduce duplicative federal
administrative structures, the debate in Washington has done little to
provide practical solutions. The Health Passport offers a tool to help
achieve these administrative savings empowering citizens and preserving the
integrity of services."
