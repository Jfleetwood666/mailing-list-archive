Read how you can earn $3 for each envelope that you fill with my 
sales materials from your own comfortable home- 100% Totally 
Guaranteed!!
          
     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;    STUFF 1000 ENVELOPES AND GET PAID $3000!       &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 

"If you stuff 1000 envelopes with our sales materials, you are 
guaranteed to be paid $3000 in cash"

Hello Friend and Job seeker,
    
     Are you looking to be your own boss, interested in creating 
and controlling your own work hours/schedule, and working from 
your comfortable home?

     How about making more money in a week than you currently 
make in a month?  Do you want to stop struggling for the low 
wages you are currently earning?

     Can you find the time to put our sales materials in 1000 
envelopes and make $3000 in cash?  How about 2000 envelopes for 
$6000 in cash?  (you decide as there is no limit:   we want to 
send out our materials continuously and abundantly)

     If you have answered yes to any of these questions...
  
Let me be the first to welcome you to BETTER SOLUTIONS.

     My name is Andrew Devore, President of Better Solutions.  I 
have perfected a method that allows you to earn $3 per envelope 
that you stuff with my sales materials.  And for a limited time, 
I am seeking out people just like you who wish to have more 
financial security, greater amounts of  spending money, an 
improved standard of living, and a desire to work at home.
  
          &lt;&lt;An Explanation of Why I Need your Assistance.&gt;&gt;

     We would like to mail our offers out to hundreds of 
thousands of people in the U.S.  And if we have home workers 
handle the jobs of stuffing and mailing, we save big money on 
overhead, extra office spaces, and having to hire more staff.
   
             THIS SYSTEM IS UNBELIEVABLY EASY TO USE:

     Absolutely anyone can do this.  You can be young or old, 
with or without a college degree.  You do not need any special 
training or even a high school diploma.  It also doesn't matter 
where you live.  I am not kidding, it is really that simple. 

     And the greatest news of all, there is no limit on how many 
envelopes you want to stuff.  If you stuff 300 envelopes, you 
will get paid $900 cash!  If you stuff 1000 envelopes, you will 
be paid $3000 cash.  You just need to follow word for word my 
straight-forward instructions and you will get paid...every 
single time...Guaranteed!

     My method will even show you how to get the envelopes with 
the addresses and stamps already on them.  This means, no 
addressing of envelopes or licking of stamps is required!  Simply 
fill the envelopes with my sales materials, put them in the mail 
box and you'll get $3 for every single one...Guaranteed!  I have 
taken the measures to make things as simple and easy as possible 
for you.

                                             
                      DON'T RISK MISSING OUT!

     I am seeking a limited number of home workers, and I will 
stop accepting orders as soon as I get enough home workers in 
your area.  To avoid losing out on the chance to be one of our 
home workers, order your "$3 per Enveloped System".

     The cost of this  system is only $55.  Included is 
everything you need to start making money immediately with easy 
step by step instructions and supplies to get you started.  And 
remember, after stuffing only 21 envelopes you'll have earned 
more than your investment back.


                   45 Day Money Back Guarantee!!!

     You have a full 45 days (that is six weeks) to use the "$3 
dollar per envelope system".  If you have not realized the money 
making potential of this system within this time, simply return 
the materials and you'll receive an immediate refund...no 
questions asked!!

Sincerely, 
    

Andrew  W. Devore, President 
Better Solutions
