&gt; If it is Monday, December 7, 1998, you can go to
&gt; http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/STATE/topstory.html and read about how
&gt; Los Angeles police wiretapped a small cellular phone service provider
&gt; because his policies were too helpful for drug dealers.  He didn't try
&gt; hard enough to verify customer names, he sold cell phones with built in
&gt; scramblers, he allowed customers to change phones and numbers easily.
&gt; After years of investigation the company owners were never charged,
&gt; but a number of their customers were convicted as drug dealers, in many
&gt; cases never being told about the phone taps.
&gt; 
&gt; It's an ominous account of how privacy-friendly policies can be used by
&gt; the police to justify an investigation.

I am curious if the whole provider was just a front for the law
enforcement.

igor

&gt; If it's after December 7, read the story here:
&gt; 
&gt; :      Los Angeles narcotics officers spent a lot of time spying on John
&gt; : Lopez and his small storefront telephone company--Atel Cellular
&gt; :      Convinced he was in cahoots with drug dealers by selling secure,
&gt; : cop-proof phone service--no questions asked--they staked out his
&gt; : Downey office, tailed his customers and finally wiretapped the
&gt; : customers' and Atel's phones.
&gt; :      Starting with just his business lines and a handful of customers,
&gt; : the operation spread like kudzu, eventually covering hundreds of
&gt; : phones and thousands of conversations and becoming the largest wiretap
&gt; : operation in the history of Los Angeles County.
&gt; :      When the three-year probe ended in March, police had arrested
&gt; : dozens of Atel's customers, but not Lopez or any of his employees.
&gt; :      The Atel taps are at the center of the nine-month legal
&gt; : controversy over whether prosecutors have been improperly concealing
&gt; : their wiretapping operation and the information derived from it. Also
&gt; : at issue are charges by defense lawyers representing Atel customers
&gt; : that the allegations against Atel Cellular are a sham created to win
&gt; : court orders permitting an electronic fishing expedition against their
&gt; : clients.
&gt; :      Manager Lopez and Atel's owner, Atil Nath, refused to
&gt; : comment. Their lawyers say the two men are not involved in drugs.
&gt; :      "The whole concept [of the police wiretap operation] was
&gt; : preposterous," said Dale Hardeman, a Downey attorney. "How are we
&gt; : supposed to know if customers are involved in criminal activity?"
&gt; :      Details of the probe--revealed through interviews, police
&gt; : affidavits, wire monitor logs and volumes of court records--provide a
&gt; : fascinating inside look at how detectives can mold the legal actions
&gt; : of a suspect into criminal scenarios and persuade judges to authorize
&gt; : snooping on people's private conversations.
&gt; :      The probe also raises broader questions, such as whether many of
&gt; : the reasons given for tapping Atel could just as easily be applied to
&gt; : other phone companies, and whether wiretaps should be allowed to
&gt; : continue indefinitely, even when police work for months without
&gt; : finding enough evidence to arrest the target.
&gt; :      The 4th Amendment protects phone privacy.
&gt; : 
&gt; :      Need for Probable Cause
&gt; : 
&gt; :      To tap a phone, prosecutors have to get a court order by showing
&gt; : they have sufficient reason, known as probable cause, to believe the
&gt; : phone subscriber is committing crimes. Even if a subscriber's actions
&gt; : are legal when considered individually, those actions can amount to
&gt; : probable cause when viewed as part of a larger picture.
&gt; :      If a tap provides a lead or evidence, prosecutors must reveal the
&gt; : tap and give transcripts to the defendant before trial.
&gt; :      Though the Atel investigation established strong suspicion among
&gt; : investigators that Lopez knew he was dealing with drug traffickers, it
&gt; : fell far short of proving it.  But police were getting a steady supply
&gt; : of leads against his customers as well as new phone numbers of people
&gt; : they considered suspicious. So they kept going back to court for
&gt; : extensions and new taps.
&gt; :      Police referred all questions about the case to prosecutors, who
&gt; : defend the wiretap practice, saying they had sufficient evidence to
&gt; : suspect Lopez of wrongdoing.
&gt; :      Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti noted in a prepared statement that the
&gt; : operation had court approval. He said police targeted Atel because
&gt; : they believed most of its business was providing phones to drug
&gt; : dealers without requiring them to provide any personal information.
&gt; :      Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk, who approved most of the
&gt; : orders, said he could not discuss pending cases.
&gt; :      Not much is known about Lopez and Nath. Nath lives in a two-story
&gt; : home in a neat, well-kept neighborhood in Downey. Lopez lives in Pico
&gt; : Rivera with his wife, Maria, and their children. Both have said in
&gt; : court papers that they have no criminal record. Their company is one
&gt; : of about three dozen small phone companies in Los Angeles County that
&gt; : resell or sublease service and equipment.
&gt; :      Police say the closest they came to showing a direct connection
&gt; : between Lopez and drugs was during a stakeout at his home when they
&gt; : saw a man arrive in a pickup truck registered to a member of what they
&gt; : say is a drug gang.
&gt; :      The investigation grew out of, and, in many ways, was modeled
&gt; : after a 1994 wiretap of Downey Communications, another small retailer
&gt; : of phone services. As in the Atel probe, police staked out the
&gt; : business and collected information for wiretap orders.
&gt; :      During hours of surveillance, they watched customers arrive and
&gt; : leave. They noticed the types of vehicles they drove. They even took
&gt; : notes on their manner of dress, eventually deciding that silk floral
&gt; : shirts, pressed denim, hand-stitched leather belts and expensive
&gt; : cowboys boots were haute couture on the L.A. drug scene.
&gt; :      Police claimed that Downey leased to drug dealers and was
&gt; : "heavily involved in the sale and transportation of narcotics."
&gt; : Officers would later use the same language in Atel affidavits.
&gt; :      The Downey wiretaps lasted a year. They ended in drug and cash
&gt; : seizures and 12 indictments, including one against the brother of
&gt; : Downey's owner. But the owners and employees of Downey were not
&gt; : arrested. The owner said in court papers he was never interviewed by
&gt; : police, was not aware of the investigation and has never been charged
&gt; : with a crime.
&gt; :      Police used the Downey Communications probe as a springboard to
&gt; : Atel.
&gt; :      The connection was tenuous.  Downey and Atel customers shared the
&gt; : same taste in cars and fashion.  Downey employees were seen paying
&gt; : short visits to Delta Tri-Telesis, a now-defunct cellular phone
&gt; : business owned by Nath and operated by Lopez.
&gt; :      So in September 1995, officers turned their binoculars on Atel,
&gt; : which had taken Delta's customers.  They often saw customers in cars
&gt; : registered to targets of previous drug probes going to houses once
&gt; : used as drug "stash" sites and employing what police considered
&gt; : "counter-surveillance" driving.
&gt; : 
&gt; :      Reports on Surveillance
&gt; : 
&gt; :      Investigators say they saw Lopez use such techniques when they
&gt; : were tailing him in May 1996, shortly before they started tapping his
&gt; : business phones. They said they saw him on the freeway changing lanes
&gt; : erratically and driving "at a high rate of speed in excess of 70 miles
&gt; : per hour," later making a U-turn on Arrington Avenue and lingering too
&gt; : long--three minutes--at an intersection.
&gt; :      Police also noted in affidavits that Lopez sold money counters
&gt; : and phone scramblers; that he apparently didn't care if customers gave
&gt; : him fictitious names; that he let customers change numbers quickly and
&gt; : easily.
&gt; :      Drug suspects were frequently found with Atel phones.
&gt; :      Police saw what they considered suspicious calling patterns--too
&gt; : many calls in a short period of time--among groups of Atel customers.
&gt; :      Although such evidence was far from enough to file charges
&gt; : against Lopez and Nath, legal experts say it was sufficient as
&gt; : probable cause for a court order, which was granted in May 1996 for 30
&gt; : days.
&gt; :      After a month of wiretapping, Garcetti's prosecutors--armed with
&gt; : transcripts of tapped phone conversations--were back in court asking
&gt; : for the first extension of the court order and for permission to tap
&gt; : new telephone numbers. From then on, requests for extensions built on
&gt; : previous ones. Police eventually received 19 extensions.
&gt; :      Although the taps provided a mother lode of leads against drug
&gt; : dealers, they seldom offered much evidence against Atel. There was one
&gt; : conversation that police described in an affidavit as particularly
&gt; : damning for Lopez. It was on June 25, 1996, from "Oscar," who had been
&gt; : under police surveillance.
&gt; :      "Hey John, this number is no good," Oscar tells Lopez.
&gt; :      Lopez: Not good?
&gt; :      Oscar: They're on me again!  Right behind.
&gt; :      Lopez: OK, bring it in now!
&gt; :      But most of Lopez's conversations in the affidavits simply
&gt; : confirmed what police already knew: that customers dealt directly with
&gt; : Lopez, that Lopez based billing records on phone numbers instead of
&gt; : names and that he handled billing arrangements by phone.
&gt; :      In contrast, the conversations among customers were
&gt; : fruitful. Most were cryptic discussions about drug deals, pickup
&gt; : locations, delivery times, police said. According to investigators,
&gt; : they never mentioned drugs, using words such as "ladies," "stuff" or
&gt; : simply a number understood to be an amount of drugs.
&gt; :      For example, in June 1996, police overheard this exchange:
&gt; :      Receiver: How do they look?
&gt; :      Caller: Real good. How many do you have?
&gt; :      Receiver: 40 plus 5 out, plus some lying around.
&gt; :      Caller: OK. I'll hold whatever else I have.
&gt; :      Without interpretation by detectives, there is little indication
&gt; : that that conversation is about drugs.
&gt; :      By the time the operation ended in March, police had tapped close
&gt; : to 400 Atel phones.
&gt; :      The wiretap controversy erupted that month because San Diego
&gt; : attorney Philip DeMassa and two other lawyers discovered that the case
&gt; : against their clients sprang from information garnered from the Atel
&gt; : taps and handed off to other officers who were not told of the taps so
&gt; : they would not have to reveal them to defense lawyers.  Later, Deputy
&gt; : Public Defender Kathy Quant went to court for indigent defendants.
&gt; :      Garcetti acknowledged in June that he withheld tap information in
&gt; : 58 cases and he agreed to notify defendants about future taps.
&gt; : Although a judge upheld the wiretap handoff practice last month, with
&gt; : some qualifications, Quant is considering an appeal. Other defense
&gt; : lawyers are challenging whether Garcetti has revealed all tap cases.
&gt; :      Whatever the outcome, the probe clearly helped police arrest some
&gt; : of Atel's customers. It netted large amounts of narcotics, about $8
&gt; : million in drug proceeds and dozens of arrests.
&gt; :      Lawyers base their doubts about the investigation of Nath and
&gt; : Lopez partially on the fact that it lasted three years and police
&gt; : never tried to interview them. In fact, DeMassa alleges in court
&gt; : papers that Lopez and Nath are actually police informants or are
&gt; : perhaps cooperating through a grant of immunity from prosecution, an
&gt; : assertion prosecutors call absurd.
&gt; :      DeMassa is hoping to show that police misled the courts when they
&gt; : said they were investigating Lopez and Nath.
&gt; :      If Nath and Lopez were such an integral part of a gigantic drug
&gt; : trafficking operation, the police should be trying to protect the
&gt; : public from them, he said.
&gt; :      "Why isn't anything happening to these guys?" he said.
&gt; : 
&gt; :      Acts Were Not Illegal, Critics Say
&gt; : 
&gt; :      None of Atel's acts described in the affidavits was illegal,
&gt; : Quant and other critics say.  Well-known phone companies engage in
&gt; : many of the same practices, Quant said. If police use the same
&gt; : standards elsewhere, any companies, especially small retailers, may be
&gt; : vulnerable to taps.
&gt; :      Many of the actions cited in Atel affidavits are suspicious only
&gt; : in the eyes of police, Quant said.  Money counters are legitimate, and
&gt; : other firms advertise "no eavesdropping" cell phones because
&gt; : legitimate businesses need secure communications, she said.
&gt; :      There is nothing suspicious, for example, about high usage of
&gt; : cell phones, particularly among real estate agents, salespeople, even
&gt; : news reporters, Quant said.  And other small retailers allow people to
&gt; : change numbers frequently.
&gt; :      Regardless of Atel's guilt or innocence, what police did to Atel
&gt; : could be done to any legitimate businesses, she said.
&gt; :      Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Schirn dismissed that notion.
&gt; :      "That's quite a stretch," he said.
&gt; :      "Atel was a facilitator and made it possible for drug dealers to
&gt; : break the law," he said.
&gt; :      Yet Schirn acknowledged that he could not point to any conclusive
&gt; : evidence that Nath and Lopez knew that some of their customers were
&gt; : drug dealers.
&gt; :      He said he didn't know if police tried to persuade defendants to
&gt; : testify against Nath or Lopez.  Even if they did, prosecutors would
&gt; : need more evidence than the tainted testimony of accomplices to make
&gt; : an arrest, he said.
&gt; :      As for Atel, Hardeman said his clients had no idea some of their
&gt; : customers were criminals.
&gt; :      "This investigation has virtually destroyed them," he said.
