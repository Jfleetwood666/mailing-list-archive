Now there's a really intelligent response to the MIB! I think Blanc would
have done a better self-service to have responded that way.

MAKE THEM GET A WARRANT! It's your ONLY legal defense against a fishing
expedition! It's our CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to require a warrant before
letting them in! We are NOT criminals just because we do not allow the MIBs
to make ILLEGAL and UNCONSTITUTIONAL searches of our properties!

If they can't convince a judge AND obtain a specifically worded search
warrant then they are obviously fishing! Tell to go find a real deep lake...

I also give the writer an A+ for the Clintonian and Reagonesque touches!

&gt;
&gt;Hello, I'm Special Agent Murfrock of the IRS and this is Special 
&gt;Agent Prenfrew. We'd like to speak with you about C. J. Parker, 
&gt;maybe known to you as "Toto" or "TruthMonger..."
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, I don't recognize any of those. Isn't Toto the dog?
&gt;
&gt;The dog?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, Dorothy's dog in... (stops when he notices that the agents are
&gt;scribbling furiously in their notebooks)
&gt;
&gt;May we come in?
&gt;
&gt;No, I was just about to go to sleep. I'm not well.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to hear that. We have an e-mail here that you sent to Toto, 
&gt;and another he sent back to you...
&gt;
&gt;May I see those? (takes the printouts)
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.
&gt;
&gt;Well, if you look at those headers, the ones circled in red, you
&gt;will see that...
&gt;
&gt;You must be kidding! There are more people forging e-mail headers
&gt;than live in St. Louis! Everybody knows that.
&gt;
&gt;Would you mind if we just come in for a moment?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I would. I told you, I am going to sleep.
&gt;
&gt;Would you mind if we look at your computer?
&gt;
&gt;Why would you want to do that?
&gt;
&gt;Well if you didn't send or receive these messages, you have 
&gt;nothing to worry about.
&gt;
&gt;I don't see any reason to do that.
&gt;
&gt;We can get a warrant, very quickly, as a matter of fact. If you
&gt;cooperate, things will go better for you.
&gt;
&gt;I love to cooperate. I want to cooperate. I am cooperating to the
&gt;fullest extent I believe is required of me. Ask me something that
&gt;makes sense and I'll answer it.

We have learned sooo much from our wonderful President Clinton, haven't we?!

&gt;
&gt;Have you ever heard of a group called the Cypherpunks?
&gt;
&gt;It rings a bell.
&gt;
&gt;Are you a member?
&gt;
&gt;No.
&gt;
&gt;How do you explain the fact that we found your e-mail address on
&gt;a Cypherpunks membership list in a computer we seized?
&gt;
&gt;I have no idea. I don't join organizations.
&gt;
&gt;Are you a member of the Majordomo organization?
&gt;
&gt;No. The only majordomo I've ever heard of is a mail list manager.
&gt;
&gt;Where have you seen this Majordomo?
&gt;
&gt;Oh, everywhere. I think it's worldwide in scope.
&gt;
&gt;(scribble scribble)
&gt;
&gt;It's some kind of utility program. Everybody uses it.
&gt;
&gt;(scribbling stops)
&gt;What can you tell us about it?
&gt;
&gt;Nothing, really. If you want to get on a mail list you send a
&gt;"subscribe" message to a majordomo. If you want to get off, I
&gt;think you send an "unscrive" message.
&gt;
&gt;Have you ever done that?
&gt;
&gt;Maybe. I don't recall. Anyone can submit your e-mail address 
&gt;to lists, so you don't even have to subscribe to be on an 
&gt;e-mail list. And there's so much spam these days that I don't 
&gt;recognize half the stuff I get. 
&gt;
&gt;Spam? (the agents look at each other)
&gt;
&gt;Junk e-mail. I delete most of my e-mail without even reading it.
&gt;Sometimes my email program crashes and it all gets deleted before
&gt;I can look at it.
&gt;
&gt;(scribble scribble)
&gt;How many lists have you joined?
&gt;
&gt;I don't remember. I never paid any attention to those things,
&gt;and since I banged my head three months ago, I haven't been
&gt;remembering a lot of things.
&gt;
&gt;(scribble scribble)
&gt;So, are you denying being a member of the Cypherpunks?
&gt;
&gt;I don't know what that means.
&gt;
&gt;Have you ever subscribed to the Cypherpunks e-mail list?
&gt;
&gt;I have no idea.
&gt;
&gt;You have no idea? You don't remember?
&gt;
&gt;I don't know what I've subscribed to, unsubscribed from,
&gt;what I get, don't get. E-mail is a complete mess and I
&gt;ignore most of it. I'm really not very good at those
&gt;things.
&gt;
&gt;May we look?
&gt;
&gt;No.
&gt;
&gt;Are you going to make us get a warrant?
&gt;
&gt;Get what you like. My disk crashed last week and I threw it away.
&gt;Lost everything. In fact I just formatted my new disk and the 
&gt;only data on it is manuscripts for the columns I write.
&gt;
&gt;Columns?
&gt;
&gt;I write for a magazine and a couple of newspapers.
&gt;
&gt;(oh shit)
&gt;(scribble scribble)
&gt;Oh yeah? Which ones?
&gt;
&gt;I don't think that's appropriate.
&gt;
&gt;Well, we'll be back. Here's my card in case you think of anything
&gt;you'd like to tell us.
&gt;
&gt;Sure.
&gt;
&gt;One more thing. Have you ever been invited to join something
&gt;called The Circle of Eunuchs, e-u-n-u-c-h-s?
&gt;
&gt;I don't recall ever hearing of anything like that.
&gt;
&gt;Do you know who Tim May is?
&gt;
&gt;Nope. Sounds like a real common name, though.
&gt;
&gt;How about Blanc?
&gt;
&gt;Is that French?
&gt;
&gt;Never mind. Thanks. We'll be seeing you.
&gt;
&gt;(I don't _think_ so)
&gt;
