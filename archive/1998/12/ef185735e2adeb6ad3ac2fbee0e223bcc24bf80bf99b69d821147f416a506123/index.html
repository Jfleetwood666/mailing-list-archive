MENTOR PROGRAM (YOU SEND YOUR OWN E-MAIL)
All of us at one time or another have seen a professional do 
his/her job 
and said "I can do that" but just didn't know where to get the 
supplies, 
who to talk to, or ...just how to get started. Wouldn't it be 
great if 
someone would just spend a little time "holding our hand" while we 
got 
the hang of it? Maybe let us in on some of the little secrets that 
took 
them years to figure out.....most of us would pay a pretty penny 
for a 
professional to spend time with us, one on one, and share the 
secrets 
that has taken him/her years to master.

OUR MENTOR PROGRAM is the answer! We set you up with a proven 
commercial 
bulk e-mailing software program capable of sending over 100K 
messages an 
hour (after it is registered) using your existing computer, and it 
is so 
easy to use a child could use it, a targeting software to identify
just about any criteria you can think of, plus a CD of e-mail 
names, 
and most important...insider "tricks to the trade" from some of 
the 
best mass mailers in the world so that you can send your own bulk 
e-mail. 

The main advantage is, that after your initial expense, you can 
send mass 
e-mail when you want at NO COST and can really fine tune your ad

help and complete "hand holding" while you get up to speed at 
sending 
your own mass e-mail. And if you like, we will set you up in an

little 
bit, you can make you thousands of $$$ every month. Those that 
work a 
little harder will make lots more $$$$$$$$$ every month.
