there must be something here that I'm missing.  At the core of this
protocol seems to be the establishment not of crypto anarchy but of a
crypto elite. in this scheme only the processors of computing power  have
economic power.  Now I realize that our current economic system is based on
economic power being invested in a closed community of powerful elites, and
is by no means egalitarian, but this looks to be like simply substituting
one group of "haves" for a different group of "haves"

I have to admit not being familiar with the Orthodoxy of crypto anarchy,
but if the premise is a centerless self organizing system of free agents
this protocol seems to miss the mark. or what is it that I am missing here?

&gt;Wei Dei recently announced (on cypherpunks) his "b-money, a new
&gt;protocol for monetary exchange and contract enforcement for
&gt;pseudonyms".
&gt;
&gt;Below is the text of his proposal.
&gt;
&gt;Comments to follow.

&gt;
&gt;I am fascinated by Tim May's crypto-anarchy. Unlike the communities
&gt;traditionally associated with the word "anarchy", in a crypto-anarchy the
&gt;government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and
&gt;permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is
&gt;impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible
&gt;because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical
&gt;locations.
&gt;
&gt;Until now it's not clear, even theoretically, how such a community could
&gt;operate. A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants,
&gt;and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way
&gt;to enforce contracts. Traditionally these services have been provided by
&gt;the government or government sponsored institutions and only to legal
&gt;entities. In this article I describe a protocol by which these services
&gt;can be provided to and by untraceable entities.
&gt;
&gt;I will actually describe two protocols. The first one is impractical,
&gt;because it makes heavy use of a synchronous and unjammable anonymous
&gt;broadcast channel. However it will motivate the second, more practical
&gt;protocol. In both cases I will assume the existence of an untraceable
&gt;network, where senders and receivers are identified only by digital
&gt;pseudonyms (i.e. public keys) and every messages is signed by its sender
&gt;and encrypted to its receiver.
&gt;
&gt;In the first protocol, every participant maintains a (seperate) database
&gt;of how much money belongs to each pseudonym. These accounts collectively
&gt;define the ownership of money, and how these accounts are updated is the
&gt;subject of this protocol.
&gt;
&gt;1. The creation of money. Anyone can create money by broadcasting the
&gt;solution to a previously unsolved computational problem. The only
&gt;conditions are that it must be easy to determine how much computing effort
&gt;it took to solve the problem and the solution must otherwise have no
&gt;value, either practical or intellectual. The number of monetary units
&gt;created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a
&gt;standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours
&gt;to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3
&gt;standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer
&gt;on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that
&gt;problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.
&gt;
&gt;2. The transfer of money. If Alice (owner of pseudonym K_A) wishes to
&gt;transfer X units of money to Bob (owner of pseudonym K_B), she broadcasts
&gt;the message "I give X units of money to K_B" signed by K_A. Upon the
&gt;broadcast of this message, everyone debits K_A's account by X units and
&gt;credits K_B's account by X units, unless this would create a negative
&gt;balance in K_A's account in which case the message is ignored.
&gt;
&gt;3. The effecting of contracts. A valid contract must include a maximum
&gt;reparation in case of default for each participant party to it. It should
&gt;also include a party who will perform arbitration should there be a
&gt;dispute. All parties to a contract including the arbitrator must broadcast
&gt;their signatures of it before it becomes effective. Upon the broadcast of
&gt;the contract and all signatures, every participant debits the account of
&gt;each party by the amount of his maximum reparation and credits a special
&gt;account identified by a secure hash of the contract by the sum the maximum
&gt;reparations. The contract becomes effective if the debits succeed for
&gt;every party without producing a negative balance, otherwise the contract
&gt;is ignored and the accounts are rolled back. A sample contract might look
&gt;like this:
&gt;
&gt;K_A agrees to send K_B the solution to problem P before 0:0:0 1/1/2000.
&gt;K_B agrees to pay K_A 100 MU (monetary units) before 0:0:0 1/1/2000. K_C
&gt;agrees to perform arbitration in case of dispute. K_A agrees to pay a
&gt;maximum of 1000 MU in case of default. K_B agrees to pay a maximum of 200
&gt;MU in case of default. K_C agrees to pay a maximum of 500 MU in case of
&gt;default.
&gt;
&gt;4. The conclusion of contracts. If a contract concludes without dispute,
&gt;each party broadcasts a signed message "The contract with SHA-1 hash H
&gt;concludes without reparations." or possibly "The contract with SHA-1 hash
&gt;H concludes with the following reparations: ..." Upon the broadcast of all
&gt;signatures, every participant credits the account of each party by the
&gt;amount of his maximum reparation, removes the contract account, then
&gt;credits or debits the account of each party according to the reparation
&gt;schedule if there is one.
&gt;
&gt;5. The enforcement of contracts. If the parties to a contract cannot agree
&gt;on an appropriate conclusion even with the help of the arbitrator, each
&gt;party broadcasts a suggested reparation/fine schedule and any arguments or
&gt;evidence in his favor. Each participant makes a determination as to the
&gt;actual reparations and/or fines, and modifies his accounts accordingly.
&gt;
&gt;In the second protocol, the accounts of who has how much money are kept by
&gt;a subset of the participants (called servers from now on) instead of
&gt;everyone. These servers are linked by a Usenet-style broadcast channel.
&gt;The format of transaction messages broadcasted on this channel remain the
&gt;same as in the first protocol, but the affected participants of each
&gt;transaction should verify that the message has been received and
&gt;successfully processed by a randomly selected subset of the servers.
&gt;
&gt;Since the servers must be trusted to a degree, some mechanism is needed to
&gt;keep them honest. Each server is required to deposit a certain amount of
&gt;money in a special account to be used as potential fines or rewards for
&gt;proof of misconduct. Also, each server must periodically publish and
&gt;commit to its current money creation and money ownership databases. Each
&gt;participant should verify that his own account balances are correct and
&gt;that the sum of the account balances is not greater than the total amount
&gt;of money created. This prevents the servers, even in total collusion, from
&gt;permanently and costlessly expanding the money supply. New servers can
&gt;also use the published databases to synchronize with existing servers.
&gt;
&gt;The protocol proposed in this article allows untraceable pseudonymous
&gt;entities to cooperate with each other more efficiently, by providing them
&gt;with a medium of exchange and a method of enforcing contracts. The
&gt;protocol can probably be made more efficient and secure, but I hope this
&gt;is a step toward making crypto-anarchy a practical as well as theoretical
&gt;possibility.
