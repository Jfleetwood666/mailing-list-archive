&lt;U&gt;WITHOUT GIVING UP&lt;/U&gt; THE FOOD YOU LOVE!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;

 Eat the Foods You Love   Preferred by Fitness Experts   100% Safe and Natural
&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;
&lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;AN INCREDIBLE NUTRITIONAL BREAKTHROUGH!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=LEFT&gt;     I know what you're thinking. I felt the same way at first....but I found that there &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;is&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; finally a way to trim down and shed unwanted fat without all the hassles of a diet and strenuous exercise. Yes, there's actually a way to firm up without giving up the food you love. And it's so easy! I just take one &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift(tm)&lt;/B&gt; capsule twice a day...and that's it! Sure, exercise and daily activity will contribute to your results, but they're not required! And just think...no messy powders or mixes. No starvation. No rationing your food by the ounce. &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift(tm)&lt;/B&gt; improves your metabolism &lt;B&gt;so your body burns the excess fat!  &lt;/B&gt;I actually noticed my clothes fitting better before I noticed the pounds coming off! 
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;METABOLISM IS THE KEY&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=LEFT&gt;     Anyone who has struggled to lose weight can tell you diets alone don't work! That's because your size, or your weight, has more to do with your metabolism than what you eat.
     &lt;I&gt;Changes International&lt;/I&gt; has designed a product that works several ways to help you achieve maximum results from your weight-loss program. This unique blend of herbs, botanicals and Chromium Picolinate improves your metabolism so your body relies more on stored body fat and less on stored proteins. 
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;STOP THE YO-YO CYCLE!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=LEFT&gt;     On a typical diet, up to 30% of lost weight is muscle. Losing muscle lowers your metabolic rate and slows the burning of calories. This lower metabolic rate also makes it hard to keep lost pounds from creeping back. Result: the Yo-Yo syndrome! You know, up and down...up and down. &lt;B&gt;After each lose-gain cycle the proportion of fat actually increases!&lt;/B&gt;
     To break this vicious cycle, it is important to lose only fat while maintaining... or even increasing... muscle! Our unique formula is a specialized combination of herbs and botanicals coupled with the best source of chromium available. Patented Chromium Picolinate, a bio-active chromium with clinically proven benefits, is vital to good health and is essential for the effective functioning of insulin.
     &lt;B&gt;Studies have shown chromium nutrition to be an effective part of LONG-TERM fat loss programs!
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;I&gt;NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=LEFT&gt; Three million readers of &lt;I&gt;Cosmopolitan&lt;/I&gt; read a discussion of Chromium Picolinate's value for dieters under the headline, "A Miracle Mineral?".
 The cholesterol-reducing effect of Chromium Picolinate was highlighted in &lt;I&gt;Ladies Home Journal&lt;/I&gt;.
 &lt;I&gt;Longevity&lt;/I&gt; magazine has praised it as a safe alternative to anabolic steroids. 
 A large number of publications for athletes and health food shoppers have also run feature articles on Chromium Picolinate, including: &lt;I&gt;Prevention, Today's Living, Total Health &lt;/I&gt;and &lt;I&gt;Muscular Development&lt;/I&gt;.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;HERE'S MORE EVIDENCE!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=LEFT&gt;     Several double-blind crossover studies conducted along with clinical and laboratory tests at a leading university and hospital have proven that the ingredients in &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift(tm)&lt;/B&gt; are effective. Without changing dietary or exercise habits over a 6-week period, subjects in separate studies lost an average of 23% body fat or approximately 4.4 pounds of fat, and increased lean body mass by 1.5 pounds.
     &lt;FONT  COLOR="#ff0080" SIZE=3&gt;People over the age of 46 did even better, and women seemed to do the best! People with elevated cholesterol levels averaged a 10% drop in LDL cholesterol. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;WHAT'S IN THERMO-LIFT(tm)?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=LEFT&gt;     Chromium Picolinate, Bee Pollen, Astralagus, Licorice Root, Ginger Root, Rehmannia Root, Siberian Ginseng, Ma Huang Extract, Gotu Kola, Bladderwrack, White Willow Bark, Guarana Extract and Reishi Mushroom. All ingredients are formulated and synergistically blended to be both 100% safe and effective. &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift(tm)&lt;/B&gt; is manufactured and bottled by a 25 year-old, pharmaceutical company and all FDA standards have been met or exceeded.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;THE ENERGIZERS&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=LEFT&gt;     Siberian Ginseng: Good source of energy and endurance. Increases physical and mental vigor. Ma Huang extract: Helps to increase energy, improve circulation, control appetite and decongest. The Chinese use it for treatment of asthma and other respiratory disorders. Guarana extract: Increases mental alertness and fights fatigue-a very high energy source. Rehmannia Root: Used to treat anemia, fatigue, and to promote the healing of bones. Astralagus: Acts as a tonic to protect the immune system and increases metabolism. Bee Pollen: Effective for combating fatigue, depression, and colon disorders.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;WHAT OTHERS HAVE FOUND...&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=LEFT&gt;     "My name is Denita Kellet. In just 18 months, I have been able to lose 212 pounds and over 52 inches over my entire body! I have a non-functioning thyroid and for years have fought a losing battle with a bad weight problem. Then I found &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt;...
     This product has greatly enriched my life and my health. I wish everybody could feel as good as I feel. I'm a lot more active and able to play with my family. All I can say is, thanks 110% &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt; for what you've done for me and my life." 
    &lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;I&gt; -Denita went from 340 pounds to 128 pounds in 18 months. Before and after pictures available!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/I&gt;

     "My name is Misty McDonald. I'm a twenty-two year old working mother of two children. In just five months I have lost an amazing seventy pounds. I dropped an incredible sixteen dress sizes! At 180 pounds, I was very unhappy and depressed. I felt very insecure about myself and really didn't like to go outside the house. Then I found &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt; and what a difference it has made in my life! Thank you &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt; for changing my life and making me feel complete."
     &lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;I&gt;-Misty went from 180 pounds to 110 pounds in only 5 months. Before and after&lt;/I&gt; &lt;I&gt;pictures available!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/I&gt;

     "I have been examined by my doctor and my weight loss has blown his mind! People that I used to work with, and even some family members, have trouble recognizing me. I wish everyone that is overweight could be sent my way so that I could talk to them. Maybe I could be of help, since I've lost 150 pounds so far."
    &lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt; &lt;I&gt;-Kenny went from 350 pounds to 200 pounds. Before and after pictures available!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/I&gt;

     "I started taking &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt; March 1st of this year. My sister just kept after me. I felt happy eating, and did not want to change my life, so I didn't. I just took &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt; and kept eating. I noticed my clothes getting looser on me, but I haven't kept a scale in my house for over ten years. The middle of May, I found a commercial scale and weighed myself. I had lost 50 pounds, in just 2 1/2 months! I celebrated by buying myself a new pair of jeans. I went from a size 48 waist to a size 42!
     The best part is I am a non insulin-dependent diabetic and was taking 10 mg of diabeta every day to control my blood sugar. I monitor my blood sugar myself, and with &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt; my sugar level went below 70 for the first time in years. My doctor has now taken me off my medication, and &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt; is keeping up very good. I still watch it closely, but I hate to be chemically dependent like that. I thank my sister every week for turning me on to &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt;."
     &lt;FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;I&gt;-Bernie has lost 60 pounds so far... and is still going!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3&gt;&lt;/I&gt;

     "Over the last 10 years, I have tried a variety of weight loss methods, spent thousands of dollars and failed at all of them. By December 1995, I was the heaviest I had ever weighed-235 pounds. I had no energy. My self-esteem had hit rock bottom... I was introduced to &lt;I&gt;Changes International&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;B&gt;Thermo-Lift&lt;/B&gt; and have never looked back! My energy level has boosted and my weight loss increased... In total I have lost 70 pounds and went from a size 22 to a size 12. The  amazing part - it's so easy!
