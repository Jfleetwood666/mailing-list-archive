&gt;
&gt;The following text was written to be presented to our (Santa Clara
&gt;County's) Republican Central Committee, to wake up the moderates, that bad
&gt;laws have unintentended consequences. Feel free to use it to do similar
&gt;work.
&gt;
&gt; Also see the advice at the end, and add my own that now is the time to
&gt;turn the heat up on both Lungren the candidate and your local
&gt;representatives to the state houses that voting for more bad laws will
&gt;never get them reelected. Neither party will be safe from the backlash on
&gt;this one. Neither party can distance themselves from those consequences.
&gt;
&gt;Don't let them.
&gt;
&gt;Yours,
&gt;Mike Schrader

&gt;Confiscation Comes to California
&gt;Lungren fulfills Feinstein's fantasy
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;By Daryl N. Davis
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	They said it would never happen. Any suggestion that it would was
&gt;derided
&gt;as "NRA paranoia." They told us they only wanted "reasonable controls."
&gt;
&gt;	Well, it has happened. Gun confiscation is now the law in California.
&gt;Thank you, Dan Lungren!
&gt;
&gt;	In a letter dated November 24, 1997, The Man Who Would Be Governor
&gt;declared that SKS rifles with detachable magazines, unless the owners can
&gt;prove they acquired the rifles prior to June 1, 1989, are illegal "and must
&gt;be relinquished to a local police or sheriff's department." This is a
&gt;reversal of the opinion held by Mr. Lungren from the time he took office in
&gt;January 1991, and which has been conveyed in numerous training sessions for
&gt;peace officers, criminalists and prosecutors during the past four years.
&gt;
&gt;When the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act (AWCA) became law in
&gt;January 1989, it included "SKS with detachable magazine." At that time,
&gt;there were two distinct models-one with a fixed magazine (Type 56) and one
&gt;with a detachable, AK-47 magazine (Type 84). President Bush banned
&gt;importation of the Type 84 in 1990. Later that year, aftermarket detachable
&gt;magazines (which are not interchangeable with the AK-47 magazine) became
&gt;available for SKS rifles originally designed to use only a fixed magazine.
&gt;
&gt;	Until September 1997, Mr. Lungren's position had been that only the
&gt;Type
&gt;84 was an "assault weapon." He allowed the sale of the aftermarket
&gt;detachable magazines and of SKS rifles equipped with them. He also allowed
&gt;the sale of the SKS Sporter, basically a Type 84 that, in compliance with
&gt;the import restrictions imposed by President Bush, had its bayonet lug
&gt;ground off and was fitted to a sporting stock rather than a military stock.
&gt;
&gt;	In September 1996, the Attorney General's office asked the state
&gt;Supreme
&gt;Court to "on its own motion order review of the Court of Appeals
&gt;decision..." in the Dingman case. James Dingman had been convicted of
&gt;possession of an unregistered assault weapon (Type 56 with detachable
&gt;magazine) and his conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the
&gt;Sixth District. Chief Deputy Attorney General (now candidate for Attorney
&gt;General) David Stirling wrote:
&gt;
&gt;"The impact of the court's opinion cannot be over stated because of the
&gt;millions of SKS rifles and after-market magazines currently in circulation.
&gt;Tens of thousands of California citizens may become criminals simply by
&gt;using a perfectly lawful rifle with a lawfully purchased magazine without
&gt;adequate notice that such activity brings them within the proscriptions of
&gt;the AWCA."
&gt;
&gt;In October 1996, in response to the "unprecedented" request by the Attorney
&gt;General, the Supreme Court granted review of the Dingman case. In February
&gt;1997, the Attorney General's office filed an amicus brief with the Supreme
&gt;Court in support of Dingman; they asked that the opinion of the Court of
&gt;Appeals be "reversed."
&gt;
&gt;	In September 1997, in response to a series of blatantly biased and
&gt;aggressively uninformed hit pieces in the Los Angeles Times, Mr. Lungren
&gt;reversed himself. He withdrew his amicus brief in the Dingman case, stating
&gt;that it "inaccurately reflects the view of the Attorney General." Deputy
&gt;Attorney General Paul Bishop, who had worked on the AWCA project since
&gt;1989, was transferred.
&gt;
&gt;	Thanks to Mr. Lungren, "tens of thousands of California citizens" must
&gt;either surrender their lawfully acquired property without compensation or
&gt;become felons. Gun dealers throughout the state face felony prosecution, on
&gt;individual counts, for each detachable magazine SKS they sold during the
&gt;six years Mr. Lungren assured them it was legal to do so. Furthermore, the
&gt;opinion does nothing to clarify what constitutes a "SKS with detachable
&gt;magazine." Must the magazine be affixed to the rifle? With the rifle? The
&gt;rifle in the owner's gun safe and the magazine buried somewhere in a box of
&gt;miscellaneous parts in his/her garage?
&gt;
&gt;	On CBS's "60 Minutes" on February 5, 1995, Senator Dianne Feinstein
&gt;declared, "If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United
&gt;States for an outright [firearms] ban, picking up every one of them, Mr.
&gt;and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have done it."  Thanks to Dan
&gt;Lungren, Feinstein's fantasy is well on its way to becoming reality.
&gt;Whether Mr. Lungren's fantasy of currying favor with the loony Left at the
&gt;Los Angeles Times becomes reality, remains to be seen.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What Should I Do?
&gt;
&gt;1. If a law enforcement officer attempts to confiscate your SKS, live to
&gt;fight another day. DO NOT RESIST! Do get a receipt, though.
&gt;
&gt;2. Contact Governor Wilson and firmly but politely express your outrage at
&gt;this situation. In addition to infringing the Second Amendment, the AG's
&gt;position creates a taking of private property without just compensation
&gt;(Fifth Amendment) and an ex post facto application of the Assault Weapons
&gt;Control Act (Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 3).

&gt;Sacramento, CA 95814
&gt;Phone: 916-445-2864
&gt;FAX: 916-445-4633
&gt;
&gt;3. Become active in your local NRA Members Council. You may call the
&gt;Silicon Valley Members Council at 408-235-9175, 24 hours a day, for up to
&gt;date legislative information or for information on contacting a Members
&gt;Council in your area.
