"I finally found the secrets I've been looking for.  Your manual  
tells all and has given me the tools I need to succeed, finally a 
genuine Internet insider tells all!  If you're doing business on the 
web or have ever wanted to, this is a must have.  You're the best,
I'm making your manual into my Internet Bible! Thanks a million!"

Best Regards,
(satisfied customer) Florida

WOW!, What a value your program is! Just the secrets on
email was worth the price alone, not to mention all the other
valuable things you included. I have already put up some ads
and I eagerly anticipate positive results.

Hello Internet friend,

What I am going to share with you may well be, for many of you, 
THE opportunity to start a unique, very successful business or take an 
EXISTING one to new untouched heights, by taking advantage of some 
breakthrough trends that are making "marketing history!"  You will soon
discover the art of . . . 

"How to Really Make Money on the Information Superhighway!"

Some of you may already have purchased some "electronic
marketing course" or tried to market some product online.
Maybe you even made a sizeable profit! Whatever the case may
be; No matter how successful you are right now, you can
profit tremendously from what we are about to tell you!

FACT:  ANYONE WHO HAS THE DRIVE TO SUCCEED CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A SIZABLE PROFIT ON THE INTERNET.

FACT:  NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THE TIME TO ACTUALLY DO IT.

Why would people want to pass up this extremely valuable money making opportunity?

Because learning is the key to succeeding online.  Marketing on the Internet 
requires a wealth of  knowledge.  To learn everything you need to know 
about Marketing on the Internet takes more time than any human being 
can spare.  The small amount of Internet marketers actually making a 
sizable profit know this all too well. 

Now think about this...

WHAT IF? I could provide YOU with an incredible Marketing Package 
that encompasses all the "How To" information you need to be a success 
on the Internet.  This phenomenal package includes DETAILED Internet 
SECRETS (we don't hold anything back, its all here folks!!), which explains 
in detail how to Profit from the Internet Explosion.  Whether you have a 
business of your own or you want to start one.  It's filled with over 45 packed 
pages revealing the secrets about electronic marketing so many other online 
marketers DON'T want you to know.

I thought that might interest YOU.

Let me explain.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
 
Right now there are over sixty million people surfing the Internet.  By
the year 2000, that figure is expected to more than double. With so many 
people using the Internet, smart "net"repreneur's are taking advantage 
of what this new (in terms of true commercial application) and exciting 
medium has to offer.

The Internet presents one of the best ways to make money that has 
ever been introduced. On any given day you have the opportunity to 
reach more people than most cities have population wise. This is the 
reason so many businesses are scrambling to make their presence
known on the Internet. 

Being "online" offers a person the ability to reach multitudes of people 
from all over the world.  It also offers, to those who know how, THE 
ABILITY TO MAKE EXCELLENT MONEY. And we do mean 
excellent money!!!

CONSIDER THIS POSSIBILITY: You wake up in the morning and 
you put on a pot of coffee. As you sip on your cup of hot "brew" you 
saunter over and turn your computer on. Then, as your monitor glows 
from dim to bright, you find that you have inquiries from all sorts of 
people requesting what you have to offer. Later, after you have 
finished reading your inquiries, you stroll out to your mailbox. You 
find it is filled with letters from people from all across the world! 
What's even better though, is that the letters are FILLED WITH 
MONEY; cash, checks, and money orders. Then, after tallying 
up the totals, you find that you have made anywhere between  
$200 to $1,000 and it isn't even one o'clock in the afternoon. 
 
Think of it: NO boss, NO traffic, and NO annoying Co-workers. 
Wouldn't it feel great to wake up in the morning knowing you 
are going to be making excellent money but don't have to leave 
your house to do it!?!  Wouldn't your life be far less complicated?

The truth is, you can be one of those who become financially
independent via the Internet. AND THE BEST PART IS...IT 
DOESN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF MONEY!!

What it does require is the knowledge of how, what, and where 
to do it. That is where we can help. We provide you with 
the knowledge of how to begin earning substantial income from 
your computer via the "information superhighway".   

We can remember how overwhelming the Internet seemed when we
were first introduced to it.  We realized the marketing and profit 
potential the Internet holds, but really had no idea how to pursue it. 
In our thirst for answers and knowledge, we purchased everything 
we could find that had information on the How, What, and Where. 
We spent thousands of dollars, but we now know what works and
what doesn't.  No where, in all of our searching, could we find a 
complete packet of information for all of our questions.  That is why 
we decided to write this report.  We have compiled every proven 
method and secrets that we have learned along the way into one 
complete, easy to understand report.

This PROVEN REPORT makes believers of skeptics!  

Sound too good to be true?  That's what others have said.  That is, 
until they received their reports and saw for themselves just how easy
it is to make money on the net!


Hi NI,

I received your report and free bonuses last Saturday and wanted to
congratulate you on a job well done. I read through your report "How 
To Profit From The Internet" and I'm very impressed.  I have bought 
other books and manuals about  Online Marketing, Direct Marketing, 
E-mail, Mail Order, etc. Yours is the only one that explains the
subject  in an easy to understand language.  I finally found the 
secrets I've been looking for. 

Once again, Great Job!

Sincerely,
John Strand - Satisfied Customer



My father has always told me, "remember, Michele, there is no free 
lunch in life. You get out of life what you put into it."  Through trial 
and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start, I purchased your 
report and finally figured out how to start a very profitable business
from my home. Your report is great, you give the average person 
the tools and secrets to succeed.  I know my dad is very proud of 
me now.

I can't thank you enough =)

Michele B from Oregon


Good Morning,

I hope this finds you well.  I received your program yesterday after-
noon and read it cover to cover.  You have put together a very 
valuable resource indeed.  I have finally found the program that 
tells all!  Your program has given me the tools I need to succeed.  
Your program could truly end up being the best $39.95 I ever spent!

Your the best, I'm making your manual into my internet Bible!!  
Thanks a million!

Best Regards,
Mary Wecker

the information you'll have...just like the others who are already using 
the information and making money.  You will be surprised how quickly 
you can be earning money on the Internet!
 
So you are probably thinking to yourself, this is wonderful, but how much?  
$149.95,  $99.95 maybe even  $79.95?  You may have seen other companies 
marketing "How To" information on the Internet and charging these prices. 
People are actually buying these packages at these prices.  Why?  People 
want to know how to market a product or service the "Right" way on the 
Internet.  "How to Profit from the Internet" could easily sell for any of the 
above prices.  However, we feel that we would rather help those who 
may not have the ability to pay such a price in order to be successful.  
That is why we are offering "How to Profit from the Internet" for the 
unbelievable low price of $39.95.

That's right, that was not a typo...$39.95.  

Still skeptical???  Lets put that to rest right now.  We will make this 
completely risk free for you.  If you are not 100% satisfied with the
information you receive, and believe that you cannot use it to start a
successful business or increase your current business profits, return it
within 10 days and we will refund your money.  No questions asked!!  
(Because this information is very easy to copy, the guarantee is only 
available on Disk Orders).

I have sold this package at much higher prices in the recent past and will be
forced to raise my prices in the very near future. One of the things
you will learn in my manual is to constantly test your market.  I am
currently in the price testing phase of this marketing campaign.
On February 1st, 1998 I will be raising the price of this package
back up to $79.95 and eventually up to $129.95 to test the upscale market.
If you act quickly, you have the opportunity to get these materials today
for the unbelievable low price of $39.95.

So, if you are seriously interested in learning how to acquire wealth 
by being online, ACT NOW!!  This won't last for long!

Print out this form and mail it to the address below, with your $39.95 
cash, check, money order or credit card information.
