Allen, 
This is absolutely unbelievable. Within two days I 
have already made in excess of $200.00 and it only 
took about 2 hours to do every thing. The marketing 
reports that you supply are absolutely outstanding!!  
I have to say....my hat goes off to you. I am glad 
that there is someone out there who will give your 
moneys worth and a whole lot more!!
Thanks a Million,
J.R. (Florida)

Hi Allen,
Just a quick thank you note for creating the Warrior 
site. After a full two years of banging my head 
against the monitor screen, trying to make money on 
the internet, I finally have learned the secrets that 
I needed to make it all happen. Sponsoring people into 
my MLM program has never been easier and I don't worry 
anymore about losing my internet connection for sending 
bulk e-mail.  The contacts I have made in the forum 
have turned into pure gold and will continue to further 
educate me in the proper methods of internet marketing.  
Keep up the great work Allen!
Best Regards,
John Corbett

"I have been marketing online for a while now and I 
have more than tripled my former income working at my 
job (I have been fulltime in internet marketing for 
about 6 months now) and I only work around 15 to 20 
hours a week. During my time in this business I have 
been in contact with most of the major marketers online 
and I recommend Allen Says as the most honest and helpful 
individual I have dealt with in this business. His 
Marketing package is the best value on theinternet. 
Anyone who is thinking about doing any type of business 
on the web needs to be a member of the Internet Marketing 
Warriors."
Thank You, 
Terry Dean

Thanks for your kindness, and you can quote me on 
this: a veritable treasure-trove of money making 
ideas, the package has saved me hundreds of hours 
of research time. It is well worth joining!

Haider Aziz

This is the best $25 I ever spent. Thanks for the 
honesty &amp; quality web site.

Joining the Internet Marketing Warrior family has 
been very rewarding to me. Prior to becoming a member, 
I wasted so much time on the net unsuccessfully 
finding the kind of information &amp; internet marketing 
techniques that are available to me now as a Warrior 
member. In addition to all the money making information 
on the private site, what amazes me the most is the great 
contribution of information &amp; help provided to everyone 
by top gun professional fellow Warrior members on the 
forum. I recommend this site to anyone serious about 
making money on the net.
Best of Success,
Alan Alvarez
