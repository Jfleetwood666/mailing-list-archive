money if you have it to begin with. You 
know the saying "It takes money to make 
money". Well the little guy can barely

FREE BONUS #2
Self-Liquidating Loan Report

YES... It's possible to borrow thousands and 
never repay one penny! This remarkable system 
is explained in the manual and there are no 
credit checks, cosigners or employment 
verifications. After reviewing this report 
you could put your own Self-Liquidating Loan 
together in matter of days -- right in your 
home town -- for any reason or idea!

A "Self-Liquidating" loan is a  financial 
arrangement in which the elements of  "Arbitrage", 
"Compensating Balance" and "Advanced-Point 
Funding" are utilized. To explain each of these 
three topics would take pages, but to sum it 
up it means money that is "borrowed" NEVER has 
to be repaid! I MEAN NEVER! Since the lender 
(the Bank) deducts a "Compensating Balance" 
from the proceeds of your loan at the end of 
the term, the loan is "ROLLED OVER" or PAID OFF 
by the "Compensating Balance" funds withheld 
when the loan is made. This way, you never have 
to worry about making any loan payments. EVER! 
Now you can see why this is so remarkable! 
Truly unique!
