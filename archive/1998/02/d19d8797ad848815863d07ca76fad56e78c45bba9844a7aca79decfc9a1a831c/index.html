The local radio station just played a soundbite explaining that the 
"Anthrax" was not viable, and could not have been used to develop a 
weapon. They went on to state that the perpetrator was a "disgruntled scam 
artist whose scheme to make money off the Internet had failed."

If they can't get anything out of the bio weapons angle, there's always 
the 'net angle. The news goobers are catching onto the concept of "object 
re-use."

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Far from planning an anthrax attack, William Leavitt
&gt; Jr. was involved in a bizarre deal to buy a $2 million germ-killing
&gt; machine from an FBI informant who double-crossed him, Leavitt's
&gt; lawyers said Friday.
&gt;  
&gt; Leavitt was described by his attorneys as a well-meaning, if gullible
&gt; scientist.
&gt;  
&gt; He and Larry Wayne Harris, both microbiologists, were arrested in
&gt; suburban Henderson Wednesday outside a medical office and charged with
&gt; conspiracy to possess and possession of a biological agent.
&gt;  
&gt; His lawyers said Leavitt was operating under the assumption that what
&gt; Harris had was Anthrax vaccine, which is legal and safe.
&gt;  
&gt; The FBI was awaiting tests Friday to determine if it was vaccine or
&gt; material grade anthrax, which is potent enough to kill thousands of
&gt; people.
&gt;  
&gt; Leavitt is married with three children and runs his own
&gt; fire-protection business. The FBI says he also owns microbiological
&gt; laboratories in his hometown of Logandale, Nev., and Frankfurt,
&gt; Germany.
&gt;  
&gt; His criminal attorney, Lamond Mills, said the FBI's informant, Ronald
&gt; Rockwell, was trying to ``scam'' Leavitt into buying a germ-killing
&gt; machine.
&gt;  
&gt; ``When he couldn't scam 'em, he went the other way. He became a good
&gt; guy for the FBI,'' Mills said.
&gt;  
&gt; Leavitt's business lawyer, Kirby Wells, said the machine was called
&gt; the AZ-58 Ray Tube Frequency Instrument Prototype, and was hyped by
&gt; Rockwell in glossy brochures as being able to flush the body clean of
&gt; bacteria and viruses.
&gt;  
&gt; ``It looked like a bunch of bells and whistles,'' said Wells, who said
&gt; he saw a picture of the machine. ``What made my client believe there
&gt; was substance to that thing, I don't know. I wish I did.''
&gt;  
&gt; A promotion on the Internet has a bold headline: ``ANTHRAX,'' and goes
&gt; on to say the AZ-58 ``can treat large numbers of people at the same
&gt; time.''
&gt;  
&gt; ``Has the greatest health discovery in history been suppressed?'' the
&gt; ad asks.
&gt;  
&gt; Leavitt was close to buying the machine in a $2 million deal, but
&gt; wanted to test it before making a $100,000 down-payment and arranged
&gt; to fly Harris to Las Vegas about a week ago to help, said Wells.
&gt;  
&gt; Leavitt believed that Harris was transporting anthrax vaccine, Mills
&gt; said. But Rockwell told the FBI that Leavitt described it as
&gt; military-grade.
&gt;  
&gt; On the''NBC Nightly News'' Friday, Rockwell reiterated that Leavitt
&gt; and Harris said they had military grade anthrax.
&gt;  
&gt; ``They lied on what they were going to do,'' Rockwell said. ``It
&gt; scared me so bad.''
&gt;  
&gt; There is no phone listing for Rockwell in the Las Vegas area. His
&gt; attorney has not returned calls to The Associated Press.
&gt;  
&gt; Leavitt and Harris were arrested Wednesday night after the FBI, with
&gt; Rockwell's help, tailed the men to a medical office in suburban
&gt; Henderson. Authorities removed a cooler and petri dishes from the
&gt; office, and sealed the men's beige Mercedes in plastic before
&gt; transporting it to an Air Force base.
&gt;  
&gt; Leavitt, 47, and Harris, 46, of Lancaster, Ohio, are being held
&gt; without bond.
&gt;  
&gt; In an affidavit, the FBI said described Rockwell as a cancer research
&gt; scientist who was convicted of felony extortion in 1981 and 1982. But
&gt; the FBI has vouched for his credibility, saying he came forward
&gt; without getting a deal and was a ``citizen performing his civic
&gt; duty.''
&gt;  
&gt; Harris' attorney, Michael Kennedy, said Thursday that Rockwell's
&gt; credibility ``is something we're going to look into.''
&gt;  
&gt; It was unclear how Leavitt, a Mormon bishop with strong political
&gt; ties, got hooked up with Harris, an alleged white supremacist who has
&gt; been plugging his self-published book about germ warfare.
&gt;  
&gt; The FBI has said Harris met Rockwell last summer at a Denver science
&gt; conference, while Leavitt's attorneys said they believed Rockwell got
&gt; the men together.
&gt;  
&gt; Mills said the results of the FBI tests will determine if they remain
&gt; united in their defense. ``If the tests come back non-toxin, there is
&gt; no case,'' said Mills. ``If it comes back military grade, then whoa,
&gt; time out, that's not our fault. We separate from (Harris)
&gt; completely.''
