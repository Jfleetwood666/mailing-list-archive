Before you learn about this 'Important Announcement', please read the

United States:

New York Times:     "In concluding our review of Financial Organizations
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''      to effect change in the 90's, special attention should
be called to 'World Currency Cartel' organization based in California.  The
members of this organization are amassing hundreds of millions of dollars
in the currency market using a very LEGAL method which has NEVER
been divulged to the general public. While their purpose is not yet known,
their presence has most certainly been felt".

NBC  Nightly News:    " Members of the World Currency Cartel organization,
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''    who always keep very Low Profile of themselves ,
are some of the most powerful and wealthiest people in this hemisphere".

making rumbles in world finance market. While at this time, their game
is not completely known, they certainly be watched by those making
major moves in the curency contracts".

Financial Week:    " Watch them, monitor them, extract their knowledge
                               and try to become one of them. That is the soundest
financial advice we could give someone".

National Business Weekly :   " While this reporter has been left in the cold

amassing great fortunes overnight".
