&gt;                       HOT X86 CHIPS FOR '98 AND BEYOND
&gt;                                        
&gt;    
&gt;    [INLINE] Launching yet another x86 microprocessor into a field already
&gt;    crowded with clones isn't a good way to bet your company's future. But
&gt;    that's just what two startups and one CPU stalwart are doing, in a bid
&gt;    to beat Intel at its own game.
&gt;    
&gt;    The new ventures--Centaur Technology Inc. (Austin, Texas) and
&gt;    Transmeta Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.)--and long-time player Advanced
&gt;    Micro Devices Inc. (Sunnyvale, Calif.) each has its own twist on what
&gt;    it will take to survive in the cutthroat x86 world in 1998 and beyond.
&gt;    Let's take them one at a time.
&gt;    
&gt;    Centaur, founded by renowned microprocessor architect Glenn Henry, is
&gt;    focusing on the low end of the market, where sub-$1,000 desktop
&gt;    machines and sub-$2,000 notebooks rule. Centaur's offering, launched
&gt;    only a few months ago, is called the IDT WinChip C6 ("IDT" stands for
&gt;    Integrated Device Technology Inc., which owns Centaur). It's a
&gt;    Pentium-class processor that supports the MMX multimedia
&gt;    instruction-set extensions, a Socket-7 interface, and comes in speed
&gt;    grades of 180-MHz and 200-MHz. Centaur is positioning the C6 as a
&gt;    direct alternative to Intel's Pentium with MMX, AMD's K6, and Cyrix's
&gt;    6x86MX microprocessors.
&gt;    
&gt;    From a design standpoint, what's interesting about the C6 is that
&gt;    Henry chose not to follow the reigning trends in chip architecture.
&gt;    Instead, he took a downsized approach, implementing just those
&gt;    features he needed to deliver decent performance in a high-volume,
&gt;    low-cost CPU.
&gt;    
&gt;    "The biggest thing we did is throw out conventional thinking," Henry
&gt;    told me when we met recently. "We came to the conclusion that the
&gt;    added benefit of a lot of computer-science things wasn't worth the
&gt;    effort. We're not superscalar--we don't do out-of-order execution.
&gt;    Everyone else is designing 4-way superscalar processors, so we did a
&gt;    6-way chip."
&gt;    
&gt;    In designing the C6, Henry said his team found that, as CPU clock
&gt;    speeds approach 200-MHz, nearly half the time is spent waiting on the
&gt;    bus. So, Henry outfitted the C6 with a huge translation-look-aside
&gt;    buffer, as well as a second-level TLB, to reduce bus utilization and
&gt;    cut that wait-time to the bone.
&gt;    
&gt;    Also notable is the fact that Centaur is a tiny outfit that began life
&gt;    a scant two years ago. "Intel would like the world to believe it takes
&gt;    tens of years and dozens of people to design a microprocessor," Henry
&gt;    said. Looking at the results rolling out of Centaur, it's obvious what
&gt;    a dedicated group of engineers can accomplish.
&gt;    
&gt;    Over at AMD, a somewhat larger engineering team is already burning the
&gt;    midnight oil to design the K7 (code-named "Argon"), which will compete
&gt;    with Intel's upcoming 64-bit Merced CPU.
&gt;    
&gt;    AMD has a project team hard at work on K7, but has leaked few details.
&gt;    Publicly, AMD wants to talk more about its new MMX-enhanced K6
&gt;    processors. But K7 will be the key to AMD's long-term future, since a
&gt;    64-bit chip is a must-have for any company that wants to remain a
&gt;    viable alternative to Intel.
&gt;    
&gt;    The few details we do know emerged in October in a keynote speech at
&gt;    the Microprocessor Forum by AMD chairman Jerry Sanders. He said that
&gt;    the K7 will run at clock speeds in excess of 500-MHz and will come in
&gt;    a module that's mechanically--though not electrically--interchangeable
&gt;    with Intel's Slot 1 connector. Most interesting was the news that K7
&gt;    will use the bus protocol developed by Digital Equipment Corp. for its
&gt;    Alpha EV-6 processor.
&gt;    
&gt;    It's not clear how far along AMD is with the K7. Indeed, it will be a
&gt;    daunting task. But AMD has two things going for it in its quest.
&gt;    First, it is very strong in the simulation and verification
&gt;    department--an important factor in avoiding design flaws like the
&gt;    floating-point bug that struck Intel and its Pentium.
&gt;    
&gt;    More important, AMD knows what it's like to wrestle with design
&gt;    delays, which struck its K5 project. Concerns on the K6 job were
&gt;    reportedly behind AMD's decision to purchase NexGen in January, 1996.
&gt;    Indeed, the NexGen team provided the Nx586 core, which became the
&gt;    basis for the K6.
&gt;    
&gt;    The third, and potentially most interesting, effort involves
&gt;    Transmeta, a startup formed less than three years ago by former Sun
&gt;    Microsystems chip architect David Ditzel. Initial word had Transmeta
&gt;    at work on a PowerPC clone. Then, the buzz was that the company was
&gt;    designing a Java chip aimed at the nascent market for low-cost network
&gt;    computers. Now, it seems that Transmeta's effort is focused more on an
&gt;    x86 alternative that boasts either low-power, multimedia or
&gt;    network-computer capabilities. Or perhaps all three.
&gt;    
&gt;    One interesting tidbit to emerge from Transmeta is the news that it
&gt;    has hired Linus Torvalds, the designer of the Linux operating system.
&gt;    Apart from Torvalds' considerable software skills, he's plugged into
&gt;    an influential community of Unix programmers, which could give
&gt;    Transmeta a big leg up in any effort to design a processor tuned to
&gt;    handle real-world networked applications.
